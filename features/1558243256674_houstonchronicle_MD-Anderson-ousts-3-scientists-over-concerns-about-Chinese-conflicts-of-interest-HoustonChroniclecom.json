The agency, which has been assisted by the FBI, gave the cancer center 30 days to respond.                                                                \t                                                                \tâAs stewards of taxpayer dollars invested in biomedical research, we have an obligation to follow upâ when asked to investigate grant recipients, Dr. Peter Pisters, president of MD Anderson, told the Chronicle. âThis is part of a much larger issue the country is facing â trying to balance an open collaborative environment and at the same time protect proprietary information and commercial interests.â                                                                \tPisters said the NIH could withhold MD Anderson funding if it didnât take action, if information provided in its grant materials is inaccurate or incomplete. The cancer center received $148 million in NIH grant money in 2018.                                                                \tMD Andersonâs action comes amid heightened concern in Washington, D.C., and around the country that China and other foreign governments are exploiting U.S.-funded research for their own benefit, enlisting students and visiting scholars to pilfer intellectual property from confidential grant applications, luring scientists to run âshadow laboratoriesâ in their countries.                                                                \tPisters said MD Andersonâs reputation as the worldâs No. 1 cancer center has made it an obvious target.                                                                \t                                                                \tAcademic espionage                                                                \tThe cancer center invoked the termination process for three of the NIH-identified professors, two of whom resigned ahead of proceedings and one of whom is just beginning due process requirements, said Pisters. Officials determined termination was not warranted for one of the other professors and are still investigating the fifth.                                                                \tThe cancer center gave the Chronicle copies of internal documents regarding the five cases. The names of the scientists were redacted, but Pisters said all are Asian. The Chronicle and Science magazine have confirmed at least three are ethnically Chinese.                                                                \tThe departures are the first to become known since Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NIH, told a Senate panel earlier this month to expect related firings at institutions across the country soon. The panel and others in Congress have raised concerns about foreign theft of intellectual property at academic institutions.                                                                \tThe departures also follow an unprecedented Houston gathering last summer at which FBI officials warned Texas academic and medical institution leaders of the threat, particularly from insiders, and called on them to share with the agency any and all suspicious behavior and information. The meeting, closed but reported on by the Chronicle, was one of the first events to call attention to a new federal effort nationally to thwart economic foreign espionage occurring at the academic level.                                                                \tBut Pisters noted the FBI first notified MD Anderson about such concerns in 2015 during the Barack Obama administration. The cancer center consented to give the FBI computer hard drives containing emails for several of its staff members in December 2017, some eight months before Collins sent academic institutions across the nation a letter alerting them to the threat and requesting help curbing âunacceptable breaches of trust and confidentiality.â                                                                \t                                                                \tCollins told reporters after a Senate hearing last week that the FBI has played âa major part in providing us information.â                                                                \tSoon after Collinsâ letter was sent to more than 10,000 U.S. institutions, the NIH began emailing MD Anderson and dozens of other agency grant recipients outlining its concerns about specific individuals.                                                                \tRacial profiling alleged                                                                \tThe crackdown has roiled Chinese and Chinese-American communities in the United States and particularly at MD Anderson and the Texas Medical Center. They contend the investigations involve racial profiling and targeting and claim the probes are driving out some researchers for relatively minor offenses, sometimes based on a misreading of science.                                                                \tâScientific research depends on the free flow of ideas,â said Frank H. Wu, president of the New York-based Committee of 100, a group of influential Chinese-Americans. âOur national interest is best advanced by welcoming people, not by racial stereotyping based on where a person comes from.â                                                                \tThe Committee of 100 was among attendees at a meeting in Washington, D.C., in December at which representatives of Houstonâs Asian community joined others in expressing concern to the FBI about the fear and suspicions created by the agencyâs investigations and actions. And in March, a group of Chinese-American scientists voiced concern in a strongly worded letter in Science that recent rhetoric and proposals by the NIH and FBI could lead to unjust targeting of Chinese scientists.                                                                \t                                                                \tOne of the co-authors was Mien-Chie Hung, a Taiwanese-born researcher who retired as MD Andersonâs vice president for basic research in February to take a job as president of China Medical University in Taichung, Taiwan. (His move wasnât connected to any investigation, he says.)                                                                \tSources close to the MD Anderson researchers who were investigated expressed concern that the five cases donât represent the total number of employees affected by investigations conducted by the FBI and the Houston cancer center. The sources say the number is probably more than 20, given documents theyâve reviewed say the FBI access to MD Anderson computer hard drives involved the emails of 23 employees.                                                                \tIn the past 18 months months, they also note, 10 MD Anderson senior researchers or administrators of Chinese descent have retired, resigned or been placed on administrative leave. Some purportedly left of their own accord, but supporters say a toxic climate and perception of racial profiling hastened their departures. Two of the researchers subsequently took positions at Chinese institutions.                                                                \tTalent drain                                                                \tâThese are the top talents foreign countries have been trying to recruit unsuccessfully,â said Steven Pei, a University of Houston professor critical of the actions by MD Anderson. âWe are now pushing them out of the Texas Medical Center, out of Houston, out of Texas and out of the U.S. It seems weâre helping foreign countries to accomplish what they could not do by themselves. We are hurting the American competitiveness.â                                                                \tPisters downplayed the loss of talent, arguing that those affected involve âjust a handful out of MD Andersonâs 1,700 faculty.â Citing the cancer centerâs demographic breakdown â 30 percent white, 29 percent Asian, 23 percent black and 17 percent Hispanic â Pisters argued âMD Anderson faculty and employees know the institution doesnât discriminate on the basis of gender, ethnicity, race or sexual orientation.â                                                                \t                                                                \tStill, Pei wants to know why MD Anderson has become such an epicenter of the crackdown.                                                                \tThe NIH contacted Baylor College of Medicine about issues involving four of its faculty, for instance, but the Houston medical school didnât fire any, said Adam Kuspa, Baylorâs senior vice president for research. He said the institution instead worked to educate the faculty members, all ethnically Chinese, to make sure they disclose and fully describe foreign collaborations in the future.                                                                \tPisters said he has no way to know if MD Anderson has been harsher than other institutions. He said âitâs unfortunate a small group of individuals feel we have not been consistent with our core values.â                                                                \tâIn situations where individuals, small in number, have undergone investigations like this, I can understand why groups might feel that theyâre being singled out,â said Pisters. âThatâs not our intent. Weâre simply acting on NIH letters weâve received and our obligation as recipients of NIH funds.â                                                                \t$600B in thefts                                                                \tThere is no disputing the threat is real. After a 2017 report that found intellectual-property theft by China costs the U.S. as much as $600 billion annually, FBI Director Christopher Wray called China âthe broadest, most significantâ threat to the nation and said its espionage is active in all 50 states.                                                                \tIn recent years, much media coverage focused on Liu Ruopeng, a billionaire Chinese inventor who came to the United States 13 years ago to study in a Duke University researcherâs lab and later was accused of stealing information there used to develop a so-called âinvisibility cloakâ on behalf of the Chinese government.                                                                \tU.S. government agencies, including the NIH, consider Chinaâs âThousands Talentsâ program the top vehicle for transferring U.S. technology, intellectual property and know-how to China. A recruitment effort launched by the Chinese Communist Partyâs powerful Organization Department, the program aimed at luring back leading researchers of Chinese descent generally has been unsuccessful. But some U.S.-based scientists have used Thousands Talents grants as a way to fund trips to China and maintain access to research teams there.                                                                \tThe FBIâs Counterintelligence Divisionâs Strategic Partnership Program argued in a 2015 handout that the program allows China to âbenefit from years of scientific research conducted in the United States and âseverely impacts the U.S. economy.â The Chinese government censored the term Thousand Talents last fall after a General Electric engineer who had been a grant recipient was charged with trade secrets theft in New York state.                                                                \tMD Andersonâs investigations mentioned that three of the five professors likely were involved in the Thousand Talents program, none of whom had disclosed the affiliation. By contrast, none of the investigated Baylor faculty were affiliated with the program.                                                                \tMD Anderson policy permits participation in Thousand Talents, though Pisters said he wants faculty to be aware of how it operates and called it âpredatory.â The policy requires disclosure of all foreign sources of research, complete with collaboration agreements that include legal and intellectual property sharing provisions approved by the institution.                                                                \tâSerious violationsâ                                                                \tMD Andersonâs involvement with the FBI dates to a November 2015 letter from Perrye K. Turner, special agent in charge of the FBIâs Houston field office, to Less Stoltenberg, MD Andersonâs chief information security officer. The letter requested assistance in a ânational security investigationâ Turner described as âpursuant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation.â                                                                \tIn July 2017, chief legal officer Steven Haydon received a letter from Turner about âan investigation pertaining to the possible theft of MD Anderson research and proprietary information.â A month later, MD Anderson was subpoenaed for certain emails in the matter.                                                                \tA third letter from the FBI was sent to Haydon in November 2017. The next month Pisters consented to provide the bureau with access to a number of staff accounts.                                                                \tIn August 2018, MD Anderson received its first NIH email about a specific researcher. It noted the researcher had violated several NIH policies â specifically, confidentiality of peer review, failure to disclose other research resources and possibly failing to disclose a financial conflict of interest. In the weeks that followed, NIH sent four more letters to MD Anderson, each asking for more information regarding what were described as âserious violationsâ by cancer center professors.                                                                \tMax Weber, MD Andersonâs compliance and ethics officer, looked into the cases and responded with lengthy reports detailing email correspondences the accused researchers had with people in China and the titles they held at Chinese institutions. He reported examples of professors sharing confidential grant application materials with unauthorized third parties, undisclosed payments by institutions in China and the leadership of a shadow laboratory in China.                                                                \tWeber reported no evidence that any MD Anderson proprietary data was transferred to China or any other foreign nation.                                                                \tThe investigations were questioned by a source familiar with one of the cases because of Weberâs lack of expertise in matters of scientific collaboration. Pisters responded that âyou donât need a scientific background to understand these ethical issues.â                                                                \tIn response to the foreign threat, MD Anderson in 2018 developed a plan to reduce risks. In an email, Pisters warned employees of the âaccelerating risksâ of intellectual theft and cyberattacks and announced staff traveling internationally will need to use loaner laptops and phones.

The agency, which has been assisted by the FBI, gave the cancer center 30 days to respond.                                                                \t                                                                \tâAs stewards of taxpayer dollars invested in biomedical research, we have an obligation to follow upâ when asked to investigate grant recipients, Dr. Peter Pisters, president of MD Anderson, told the Chronicle. âThis is part of a much larger issue the country is facing â trying to balance an open collaborative environment and at the same time protect proprietary information and commercial interests.â                                                                \tPisters said the NIH could withhold MD Anderson funding if it didnât take action, if information provided in its grant materials is inaccurate or incomplete. The cancer center received $148 million in NIH grant money in 2018.                                                                \tMD Andersonâs action comes amid heightened concern in Washington, D.C., and around the country that China and other foreign governments are exploiting U.S.-funded research for their own benefit, enlisting students and visiting scholars to pilfer intellectual property from confidential grant applications, luring scientists to run âshadow laboratoriesâ in their countries.                                                                \tPisters said MD Andersonâs reputation as the worldâs No. 1 cancer center has made it an obvious target.                                                                \t                                                                \tAcademic espionage                                                                \tThe cancer center invoked the termination process for three of the NIH-identified professors, two of whom resigned ahead of proceedings and one of whom is just beginning due process requirements, said Pisters. Officials determined termination was not warranted for one of the other professors and are still investigating the fifth.                                                                \tThe cancer center gave the Chronicle copies of internal documents regarding the five cases. The names of the scientists were redacted, but Pisters said all are Asian. The Chronicle and Science magazine have confirmed at least three are ethnically Chinese.                                                                \tThe departures are the first to become known since Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NIH, told a Senate panel earlier this month to expect related firings at institutions across the country soon. The panel and others in Congress have raised concerns about foreign theft of intellectual property at academic institutions.                                                                \tThe departures also follow an unprecedented Houston gathering last summer at which FBI officials warned Texas academic and medical institution leaders of the threat, particularly from insiders, and called on them to share with the agency any and all suspicious behavior and information. The meeting, closed but reported on by the Chronicle, was one of the first events to call attention to a new federal effort nationally to thwart economic foreign espionage occurring at the academic level.                                                                \tBut Pisters noted the FBI first notified MD Anderson about such concerns in 2015 during the Barack Obama administration. The cancer center consented to give the FBI computer hard drives containing emails for several of its staff members in December 2017, some eight months before Collins sent academic institutions across the nation a letter alerting them to the threat and requesting help curbing âunacceptable breaches of trust and confidentiality.â                                                                \t                                                                \tCollins told reporters after a Senate hearing last week that the FBI has played âa major part in providing us information.â                                                                \tSoon after Collinsâ letter was sent to more than 10,000 U.S. institutions, the NIH began emailing MD Anderson and dozens of other agency grant recipients outlining its concerns about specific individuals.                                                                \tRacial profiling alleged                                                                \tThe crackdown has roiled Chinese and Chinese-American communities in the United States and particularly at MD Anderson and the Texas Medical Center. They contend the investigations involve racial profiling and targeting and claim the probes are driving out some researchers for relatively minor offenses, sometimes based on a misreading of science.                                                                \tâScientific research depends on the free flow of ideas,â said Frank H. Wu, president of the New York-based Committee of 100, a group of influential Chinese-Americans. âOur national interest is best advanced by welcoming people, not by racial stereotyping based on where a person comes from.â                                                                \tThe Committee of 100 was among attendees at a meeting in Washington, D.C., in December at which representatives of Houstonâs Asian community joined others in expressing concern to the FBI about the fear and suspicions created by the agencyâs investigations and actions. And in March, a group of Chinese-American scientists voiced concern in a strongly worded letter in Science that recent rhetoric and proposals by the NIH and FBI could lead to unjust targeting of Chinese scientists.                                                                \t                                                                \tOne of the co-authors was Mien-Chie Hung, a Taiwanese-born researcher who retired as MD Andersonâs vice president for basic research in February to take a job as president of China Medical University in Taichung, Taiwan. (His move wasnât connected to any investigation, he says.)                                                                \tSources close to the MD Anderson researchers who were investigated expressed concern that the five cases donât represent the total number of employees affected by investigations conducted by the FBI and the Houston cancer center. The sources say the number is probably more than 20, given documents theyâve reviewed say the FBI access to MD Anderson computer hard drives involved the emails of 23 employees.                                                                \tIn the past 18 months months, they also note, 10 MD Anderson senior researchers or administrators of Chinese descent have retired, resigned or been placed on administrative leave. Some purportedly left of their own accord, but supporters say a toxic climate and perception of racial profiling hastened their departures. Two of the researchers subsequently took positions at Chinese institutions.                                                                \tTalent drain                                                                \tâThese are the top talents foreign countries have been trying to recruit unsuccessfully,â said Steven Pei, a University of Houston professor critical of the actions by MD Anderson. âWe are now pushing them out of the Texas Medical Center, out of Houston, out of Texas and out of the U.S. It seems weâre helping foreign countries to accomplish what they could not do by themselves. We are hurting the American competitiveness.â                                                                \tPisters downplayed the loss of talent, arguing that those affected involve âjust a handful out of MD Andersonâs 1,700 faculty.â Citing the cancer centerâs demographic breakdown â 30 percent white, 29 percent Asian, 23 percent black and 17 percent Hispanic â Pisters argued âMD Anderson faculty and employees know the institution doesnât discriminate on the basis of gender, ethnicity, race or sexual orientation.â                                                                \t                                                                \tStill, Pei wants to know why MD Anderson has become such an epicenter of the crackdown.                                                                \tThe NIH contacted Baylor College of Medicine about issues involving four of its faculty, for instance, but the Houston medical school didnât fire any, said Adam Kuspa, Baylorâs senior vice president for research. He said the institution instead worked to educate the faculty members, all ethnically Chinese, to make sure they disclose and fully describe foreign collaborations in the future.                                                                \tPisters said he has no way to know if MD Anderson has been harsher than other institutions. He said âitâs unfortunate a small group of individuals feel we have not been consistent with our core values.â                                                                \tâIn situations where individuals, small in number, have undergone investigations like this, I can understand why groups might feel that theyâre being singled out,â said Pisters. âThatâs not our intent. Weâre simply acting on NIH letters weâve received and our obligation as recipients of NIH funds.â                                                                \t$600B in thefts                                                                \tThere is no disputing the threat is real. After a 2017 report that found intellectual-property theft by China costs the U.S. as much as $600 billion annually, FBI Director Christopher Wray called China âthe broadest, most significantâ threat to the nation and said its espionage is active in all 50 states.                                                                \tIn recent years, much media coverage focused on Liu Ruopeng, a billionaire Chinese inventor who came to the United States 13 years ago to study in a Duke University researcherâs lab and later was accused of stealing information there used to develop a so-called âinvisibility cloakâ on behalf of the Chinese government.                                                                \tU.S. government agencies, including the NIH, consider Chinaâs âThousands Talentsâ program the top vehicle for transferring U.S. technology, intellectual property and know-how to China. A recruitment effort launched by the Chinese Communist Partyâs powerful Organization Department, the program aimed at luring back leading researchers of Chinese descent generally has been unsuccessful. But some U.S.-based scientists have used Thousands Talents grants as a way to fund trips to China and maintain access to research teams there.                                                                \tThe FBIâs Counterintelligence Divisionâs Strategic Partnership Program argued in a 2015 handout that the program allows China to âbenefit from years of scientific research conducted in the United States and âseverely impacts the U.S. economy.â The Chinese government censored the term Thousand Talents last fall after a General Electric engineer who had been a grant recipient was charged with trade secrets theft in New York state.                                                                \tMD Andersonâs investigations mentioned that three of the five professors likely were involved in the Thousand Talents program, none of whom had disclosed the affiliation. By contrast, none of the investigated Baylor faculty were affiliated with the program.                                                                \tMD Anderson policy permits participation in Thousand Talents, though Pisters said he wants faculty to be aware of how it operates and called it âpredatory.â The policy requires disclosure of all foreign sources of research, complete with collaboration agreements that include legal and intellectual property sharing provisions approved by the institution.                                                                \tâSerious violationsâ                                                                \tMD Andersonâs involvement with the FBI dates to a November 2015 letter from Perrye K. Turner, special agent in charge of the FBIâs Houston field office, to Less Stoltenberg, MD Andersonâs chief information security officer. The letter requested assistance in a ânational security investigationâ Turner described as âpursuant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation.â                                                                \tIn July 2017, chief legal officer Steven Haydon received a letter from Turner about âan investigation pertaining to the possible theft of MD Anderson research and proprietary information.â A month later, MD Anderson was subpoenaed for certain emails in the matter.                                                                \tA third letter from the FBI was sent to Haydon in November 2017. The next month Pisters consented to provide the bureau with access to a number of staff accounts.                                                                \tIn August 2018, MD Anderson received its first NIH email about a specific researcher. It noted the researcher had violated several NIH policies â specifically, confidentiality of peer review, failure to disclose other research resources and possibly failing to disclose a financial conflict of interest. In the weeks that followed, NIH sent four more letters to MD Anderson, each asking for more information regarding what were described as âserious violationsâ by cancer center professors.                                                                \tMax Weber, MD Andersonâs compliance and ethics officer, looked into the cases and responded with lengthy reports detailing email correspondences the accused researchers had with people in China and the titles they held at Chinese institutions. He reported examples of professors sharing confidential grant application materials with unauthorized third parties, undisclosed payments by institutions in China and the leadership of a shadow laboratory in China.                                                                \tWeber reported no evidence that any MD Anderson proprietary data was transferred to China or any other foreign nation.                                                                \tThe investigations were questioned by a source familiar with one of the cases because of Weberâs lack of expertise in matters of scientific collaboration. Pisters responded that âyou donât need a scientific background to understand these ethical issues.â                                                                \tIn response to the foreign threat, MD Anderson in 2018 developed a plan to reduce risks. In an email, Pisters warned employees of the âaccelerating risksâ of intellectual theft and cyberattacks and announced staff traveling internationally will need to use loaner laptops and phones. Later, the center restricted the use of USB devices.                                                                \tA few blocks away in the medical center, Baylor is revising policy to prohibit researchers from having laboratories at two locations, domestic or foreign.                                                                \tThe only other local academic institution apparently contacted by the NIH about possible violations by a researcher was the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, which received one such letter, still under review.

The agency, which has been assisted by the FBI, gave the cancer center 30 days to respond.                                                                \t                                                                \tâAs stewards of taxpayer dollars invested in biomedical research, we have an obligation to follow upâ when asked to investigate grant recipients, Dr. Peter Pisters, president of MD Anderson, told the Chronicle. âThis is part of a much larger issue the country is facing â trying to balance an open collaborative environment and at the same time protect proprietary information and commercial interests.â                                                                \tPisters said the NIH could withhold MD Anderson funding if it didnât take action, if information provided in its grant materials is inaccurate or incomplete. The cancer center received $148 million in NIH grant money in 2018.                                                                \tMD Andersonâs action comes amid heightened concern in Washington, D.C., and around the country that China and other foreign governments are exploiting U.S.-funded research for their own benefit, enlisting students and visiting scholars to pilfer intellectual property from confidential grant applications, luring scientists to run âshadow laboratoriesâ in their countries.                                                                \tPisters said MD Andersonâs reputation as the worldâs No. 1 cancer center has made it an obvious target.                                                                \t                                                                \tAcademic espionage                                                                \tThe cancer center invoked the termination process for three of the NIH-identified professors, two of whom resigned ahead of proceedings and one of whom is just beginning due process requirements, said Pisters. Officials determined termination was not warranted for one of the other professors and are still investigating the fifth.                                                                \tThe cancer center gave the Chronicle copies of internal documents regarding the five cases. The names of the scientists were redacted, but Pisters said all are Asian. The Chronicle and Science magazine have confirmed at least three are ethnically Chinese.                                                                \tThe departures are the first to become known since Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NIH, told a Senate panel earlier this month to expect related firings at institutions across the country soon. The panel and others in Congress have raised concerns about foreign theft of intellectual property at academic institutions.                                                                \tThe departures also follow an unprecedented Houston gathering last summer at which FBI officials warned Texas academic and medical institution leaders of the threat, particularly from insiders, and called on them to share with the agency any and all suspicious behavior and information. The meeting, closed but reported on by the Chronicle, was one of the first events to call attention to a new federal effort nationally to thwart economic foreign espionage occurring at the academic level.                                                                \tBut Pisters noted the FBI first notified MD Anderson about such concerns in 2015 during the Barack Obama administration. The cancer center consented to give the FBI computer hard drives containing emails for several of its staff members in December 2017, some eight months before Collins sent academic institutions across the nation a letter alerting them to the threat and requesting help curbing âunacceptable breaches of trust and confidentiality.â                                                                \t                                                                \tCollins told reporters after a Senate hearing last week that the FBI has played âa major part in providing us information.â                                                                \tSoon after Collinsâ letter was sent to more than 10,000 U.S. institutions, the NIH began emailing MD Anderson and dozens of other agency grant recipients outlining its concerns about specific individuals.                                                                \tRacial profiling alleged                                                                \tThe crackdown has roiled Chinese and Chinese-American communities in the United States and particularly at MD Anderson and the Texas Medical Center. They contend the investigations involve racial profiling and targeting and claim the probes are driving out some researchers for relatively minor offenses, sometimes based on a misreading of science.                                                                \tâScientific research depends on the free flow of ideas,â said Frank H. Wu, president of the New York-based Committee of 100, a group of influential Chinese-Americans. âOur national interest is best advanced by welcoming people, not by racial stereotyping based on where a person comes from.â                                                                \tThe Committee of 100 was among attendees at a meeting in Washington, D.C., in December at which representatives of Houstonâs Asian community joined others in expressing concern to the FBI about the fear and suspicions created by the agencyâs investigations and actions. And in March, a group of Chinese-American scientists voiced concern in a strongly worded letter in Science that recent rhetoric and proposals by the NIH and FBI could lead to unjust targeting of Chinese scientists.                                                                \t                                                                \tOne of the co-authors was Mien-Chie Hung, a Taiwanese-born researcher who retired as MD Andersonâs vice president for basic research in February to take a job as president of China Medical University in Taichung, Taiwan. (His move wasnât connected to any investigation, he says.)                                                                \tSources close to the MD Anderson researchers who were investigated expressed concern that the five cases donât represent the total number of employees affected by investigations conducted by the FBI and the Houston cancer center. The sources say the number is probably more than 20, given documents theyâve reviewed say the FBI access to MD Anderson computer hard drives involved the emails of 23 employees.                                                                \tIn the past 18 months months, they also note, 10 MD Anderson senior researchers or administrators of Chinese descent have retired, resigned or been placed on administrative leave. Some purportedly left of their own accord, but supporters say a toxic climate and perception of racial profiling hastened their departures. Two of the researchers subsequently took positions at Chinese institutions.                                                                \tTalent drain                                                                \tâThese are the top talents foreign countries have been trying to recruit unsuccessfully,â said Steven Pei, a University of Houston professor critical of the actions by MD Anderson. âWe are now pushing them out of the Texas Medical Center, out of Houston, out of Texas and out of the U.S. It seems weâre helping foreign countries to accomplish what they could not do by themselves. We are hurting the American competitiveness.â                                                                \tPisters downplayed the loss of talent, arguing that those affected involve âjust a handful out of MD Andersonâs 1,700 faculty.â Citing the cancer centerâs demographic breakdown â 30 percent white, 29 percent Asian, 23 percent black and 17 percent Hispanic â Pisters argued âMD Anderson faculty and employees know the institution doesnât discriminate on the basis of gender, ethnicity, race or sexual orientation.â                                                                \t                                                                \tStill, Pei wants to know why MD Anderson has become such an epicenter of the crackdown.                                                                \tThe NIH contacted Baylor College of Medicine about issues involving four of its faculty, for instance, but the Houston medical school didnât fire any, said Adam Kuspa, Baylorâs senior vice president for research. He said the institution instead worked to educate the faculty members, all ethnically Chinese, to make sure they disclose and fully describe foreign collaborations in the future.                                                                \tPisters said he has no way to know if MD Anderson has been harsher than other institutions. He said âitâs unfortunate a small group of individuals feel we have not been consistent with our core values.â                                                                \tâIn situations where individuals, small in number, have undergone investigations like this, I can understand why groups might feel that theyâre being singled out,â said Pisters. âThatâs not our intent. Weâre simply acting on NIH letters weâve received and our obligation as recipients of NIH funds.â                                                                \t$600B in thefts                                                                \tThere is no disputing the threat is real. After a 2017 report that found intellectual-property theft by China costs the U.S. as much as $600 billion annually, FBI Director Christopher Wray called China âthe broadest, most significantâ threat to the nation and said its espionage is active in all 50 states.                                                                \tIn recent years, much media coverage focused on Liu Ruopeng, a billionaire Chinese inventor who came to the United States 13 years ago to study in a Duke University researcherâs lab and later was accused of stealing information there used to develop a so-called âinvisibility cloakâ on behalf of the Chinese government.                                                                \tU.S. government agencies, including the NIH, consider Chinaâs âThousands Talentsâ program the top vehicle for transferring U.S. technology, intellectual property and know-how to China. A recruitment effort launched by the Chinese Communist Partyâs powerful Organization Department, the program aimed at luring back leading researchers of Chinese descent generally has been unsuccessful. But some U.S.-based scientists have used Thousands Talents grants as a way to fund trips to China and maintain access to research teams there.                                                                \tThe FBIâs Counterintelligence Divisionâs Strategic Partnership Program argued in a 2015 handout that the program allows China to âbenefit from years of scientific research conducted in the United States and âseverely impacts the U.S. economy.â The Chinese government censored the term Thousand Talents last fall after a General Electric engineer who had been a grant recipient was charged with trade secrets theft in New York state.                                                                \tMD Andersonâs investigations mentioned that three of the five professors likely were involved in the Thousand Talents program, none of whom had disclosed the affiliation. By contrast, none of the investigated Baylor faculty were affiliated with the program.                                                                \tMD Anderson policy permits participation in Thousand Talents, though Pisters said he wants faculty to be aware of how it operates and called it âpredatory.â The policy requires disclosure of all foreign sources of research, complete with collaboration agreements that include legal and intellectual property sharing provisions approved by the institution.                                                                \tâSerious violationsâ                                                                \tMD Andersonâs involvement with the FBI dates to a November 2015 letter from Perrye K. Turner, special agent in charge of the FBIâs Houston field office, to Less Stoltenberg, MD Andersonâs chief information security officer. The letter requested assistance in a ânational security investigationâ Turner described as âpursuant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation.â                                                                \tIn July 2017, chief legal officer Steven Haydon received a letter from Turner about âan investigation pertaining to the possible theft of MD Anderson research and proprietary information.â A month later, MD Anderson was subpoenaed for certain emails in the matter.                                                                \tA third letter from the FBI was sent to Haydon in November 2017. The next month Pisters consented to provide the bureau with access to a number of staff accounts.                                                                \tIn August 2018, MD Anderson received its first NIH email about a specific researcher. It noted the researcher had violated several NIH policies â specifically, confidentiality of peer review, failure to disclose other research resources and possibly failing to disclose a financial conflict of interest. In the weeks that followed, NIH sent four more letters to MD Anderson, each asking for more information regarding what were described as âserious violationsâ by cancer center professors.                                                                \tMax Weber, MD Andersonâs compliance and ethics officer, looked into the cases and responded with lengthy reports detailing email correspondences the accused researchers had with people in China and the titles they held at Chinese institutions. He reported examples of professors sharing confidential grant application materials with unauthorized third parties, undisclosed payments by institutions in China and the leadership of a shadow laboratory in China.                                                                \tWeber reported no evidence that any MD Anderson proprietary data was transferred to China or any other foreign nation.                                                                \tThe investigations were questioned by a source familiar with one of the cases because of Weberâs lack of expertise in matters of scientific collaboration. Pisters responded that âyou donât need a scientific background to understand these ethical issues.â                                                                \tIn response to the foreign threat, MD Anderson in 2018 developed a plan to reduce risks. In an email, Pisters warned employees of the âaccelerating risksâ of intellectual theft and cyberattacks and announced staff traveling internationally will need to use loaner laptops and phones. Later, the center restricted the use of USB devices.                                                                \tA few blocks away in the medical center, Baylor is revising policy to prohibit researchers from having laboratories at two locations, domestic or foreign.                                                                \tThe only other local academic institution apparently contacted by the NIH about possible violations by a researcher was the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, which received one such letter, still under review.
