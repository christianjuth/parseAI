On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.

The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces                                                The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: \"Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.\"Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking. But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: \"The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.\"Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds

On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.

The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.

On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Some people were caught out by being tricked into clicking on a booby-trapped link                                                He says the spyware is quite insidious: \"Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on.\"NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour. The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces                                                The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: \"Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.\"Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking. But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: \"The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.\"Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds

On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Some people were caught out by being tricked into clicking on a booby-trapped link                                                He says the spyware is quite insidious: \"Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on.\"NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour. The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces                                                The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: \"Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.\"Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking. But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: \"The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.\"Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds

On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Some people were caught out by being tricked into clicking on a booby-trapped link                                                He says the spyware is quite insidious: \"Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on.\"NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour. The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces                                                The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: \"Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.\"Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking. But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: \"The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.\"Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds

On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Some people were caught out by being tricked into clicking on a booby-trapped link                                                He says the spyware is quite insidious: \"Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on.\"NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour. The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces                                                The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: \"Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.\"Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking. But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: \"The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.\"Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds

On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Some people were caught out by being tricked into clicking on a booby-trapped link                                                He says the spyware is quite insidious: \"Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on.\"NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour. The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces                                                The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: \"Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.\"Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking. But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: \"The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.\"Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds

On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Some people were caught out by being tricked into clicking on a booby-trapped link                                                He says the spyware is quite insidious: \"Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on.\"NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour. The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.

But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: \"The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.\"Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Share this story        About sharing                                                            Email                                                            Facebook                                                            Messenger                                                            Messenger                                                            Twitter                                                            Pinterest                                                            Whats App                                                            Linked In                                                                                                                                    More on this story                   Whats App discovers 'targeted' surveillance attack       14 May 2019                        Why the Whats App spies may have eyes on Iran       14 May 2019                        Use of facial recognition tech 'dangerously irresponsible'       13 May 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Technology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Google city that has angered Toronto                                                                                                18 May 2019                                From the section Technology                                                            Full article The Google city that has angered Toronto                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Video                                                                                                                                                                         Video                                                                     Minecraft's answer to Pokemon Go                                                                                                17 May 2019                                From the section Newsbeat                                                            Full article Minecraft's answer to Pokemon Go                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Microsoft and Sony in games streaming deal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Dave Lee                                North America technology reporter                                                                                                16 May 2019                                From the section Technology                        74 comments                                                            Full article Microsoft and Sony in games streaming deal                                                                                                ",

On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.

The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces                                                The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: \"Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.\"Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking. But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: \"The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.\"Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds             ",

On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.                                                                                                                            Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds When Whats App's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.The firm briefed journalists that the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.                 The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years. Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was \"pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company\".He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in Whats App being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Some people were caught out by being tricked into clicking on a booby-trapped link                                                He says the spyware is quite insidious: \"Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on.\"NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour. The Israeli firm said in a statement: \"NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. \"The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.\" Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the Whats App hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: \"We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.\"Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.                                                                                                             Image copyright                 Getty Images                                                                    Image caption                                    Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces                                                The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: \"Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.\"Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking. But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: \"The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.\"Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds             ",
