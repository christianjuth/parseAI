Avoid use of skeptics or deniers.\"          While stopping short of an outright ban, Guardian editors told staff to \"think twice\" before including them in stories.           âWe want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise in rooted facts, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,â the email to staff said.           Staff were also instructed to avoid using terms like \"biodiversity\" and \"fish stocks.\" Instead, \"wildlife\" and \"fish populations\" should be used, respectively.

Avoid use of skeptics or deniers.\"          While stopping short of an outright ban, Guardian editors told staff to \"think twice\" before including them in stories.           âWe want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise in rooted facts, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,â the email to staff said.           Staff were also instructed to avoid using terms like \"biodiversity\" and \"fish stocks.\" Instead, \"wildlife\" and \"fish populations\" should be used, respectively.

Avoid use of skeptics or deniers.\"          While stopping short of an outright ban, Guardian editors told staff to \"think twice\" before including them in stories.           âWe want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise in rooted facts, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,â the email to staff said.           Staff were also instructed to avoid using terms like \"biodiversity\" and \"fish stocks.\" Instead, \"wildlife\" and \"fish populations\" should be used, respectively.

According to an internal email the British newspaper â a proud bastion of liberalism â contends âclimate changeâ sounds ârather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.â           Rather than âclimate skeptic,\" terms like âclimate denier\" or âclimate science denierâ should be used. The email said âglobal heatingâ should be used instead of âglobal warming.\"                                                                                                                                                AD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Quality                                                                Auto                                                                360p                                                                720p                    1080p                                                          .st0{fill:#FFFFFF;}.st1{fill:#0099FF;}                                                    Editorial Director Hugo Gurdon on the expanded Washington Examiner magazine        Watch Full Screen to Skip Ads                           The Associated Press Stylebook, which is the industry standard for most media outlets, states: \"To describe those who donât accept climate science or dispute the world is warming from man-made forces, use climate change doubters or those who reject mainstream climate science. Avoid use of skeptics or deniers.\"          While stopping short of an outright ban, Guardian editors told staff to \"think twice\" before including them in stories.           âWe want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise in rooted facts, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,â the email to staff said.           Staff were also instructed to avoid using terms like \"biodiversity\" and \"fish stocks.\" Instead, \"wildlife\" and \"fish populations\" should be used, respectively.
