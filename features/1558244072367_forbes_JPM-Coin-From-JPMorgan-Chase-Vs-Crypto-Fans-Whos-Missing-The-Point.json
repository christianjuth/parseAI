The cryptocurrency (crypto) world immediately reacted with consternation.Much of the controversy concerns semantics â albeit semantics that represents key questions surrounding crypto. Just what is crypto anyway? And what is it for?                What would J. P. Morgan think about cryptocurrency?    Public domain      What JPM Coin is ForThe bankâs primary spokesperson for JPM Coin is Umar Farooq, Head of Blockchain Initiatives at JP Morganâs Corporate and Investment Bank. âJPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology,â Farooq explains. âExchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin.âFor now, the bank is limiting JPM Coin transactions to large institutional customers only, until such time as regulators have had a chance to weigh in. âJPM Coin is currently a prototype,â Farooq adds. âAs we move towards production we will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.â  In many situations, bank transactions are already instantaneous â so why bother with JPM Coin? âWith all the activity, you can see correspondent banks like JPMorgan are coming under extreme pressure because their role as middlemen is in jeopardy, so now theyâve positioned themselves as âYes, I have a network that my clients can do business and provide real-time execution,â which on the Swift network is not the case,â according to Oliver Bussmann, an active blockchain and crypto company advisor and CEO of Bussmann Advisory, who also served in CIO roles at     SAP   and     UBS  . âThatâs a game changer.âBussmann singles out the aging Swift transaction network as the primary target of JPM Coin. âMy belief is, itâs faster, cheaper and more reliable than the Swift environment, where you have an error rate of 10%-plus,â he adds. âBanks like JPMorgan especially want to be one of the first movers.âIs JPM Coin Crypto?The main reason crypto fans are riled up is because they donât identify JPM Coin as crypto at all. âWhy JPM Coin is a Joke,â writes crypto fan Linas BeliÅ«nas, business development and account executive at Contis Group. âFirst and foremost, we need to understand that JPM Coin has nothing to do with Crypto or Blockchain.âFellow Forbes contributor Madhvi Mavadiya echoes this sentiment in her recent article Stop Calling JPMorganâs JPM Coin A Cryptocurrency, Because Itâs Not. âWhy call it a cryptocurrency when it is just an internal payments system? - for press coverage?â Mavadiya asks. âThis doesnât make sense after the volatility experienced at the end of 2017 and the current attitude towards ICOs.âItâs not only crypto fans to want to distinguish between JPM Coin and crypto. âIn which way has the new alleged JPMorgan crypto coin anything to do with blockchain/crypto?â tweets crypto naysayer Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU Stern School of Business and chairman and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates. âIt is private not public, permissioned not permissionless, based on trusted authorities verifying transaction not trustless, centralized not decentralized. Calling it crypto is a joke.â (See my article on Roubini from August 2018).Roubini, in fact, has put his finger on the problem: crypto fans believe crypto should be public, permissionless, trustless, and decentralized â all things that JPM Coin is not.The problem with this widespread view of crypto, however, is that the primary purpose for such currencies is criminal enterprise, as Iâve written about before. Clearly, JPMorgan wants to have nothing to do with this criminal underworld â and if that means that JPM Coin doesnât qualify as crypto, so much the better.What Does JPM Coin Mean for Blockchain?Even though Roubini rhetorically asks whether JPM Coin has anything to do with blockchain, JPMorgan has, in fact, built its coin on top of Quorum, its own version of the Ethereum blockchain platform. âQuorum is an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum,â according to the JPMorgan web site. âQuorum addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry, and beyond.âFarooq, in fact, believes that blockchains like Quorum are essential for many types of transactions beyond JPM Coin. âThere are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary,â he says.Skeptics, however, wonder whether blockchain is overkill. âFundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain,â says Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management and head of product management, securities finance and collateral management at Broadridge. âThere are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.âNevertheless, JPMorgan has plans for JPM Coin beyond its Quorum blockchain. âThe JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms,â Farooq adds. âJPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks.âItâs not clear, however, how the bank expects to resolve the security and scalability issues of other blockchain networks â an open question that also calls into question JPMorganâs commitment to Quorum.Is JPM Coin a âStablecoinâ?One of JPM Coinâs most important characteristics is how the bank sets its value. âA JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar,â Farooq says. âJPM Coin [is] 1:1 redeemable in fiat currency held by J.P. Morgan (e.g., US$). With a $2.6 trillion balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase N.A. will redeem each JPM Coin in fiat currency.âSome people call a crypto that has a fixed fiat value a âstablecoinâ â although whether JPM Coin is a stablecoin is a controversial question of semantics, similar to the question of whether itâs a crypto at all.Clearly, JPMorgan wouldnât want its coin to be lumped together with the other stablecoins on the market, which I recently pointed out are all Ponzi schemes. The question, therefore, is whether JPM Coin is a Ponzi scheme, and if not, is it a stablecoin at all?Itâs clear that JPMorgan isnât perpetrating a con here, because it is a regulated bank with massive reserves â reserves far in excess of the number of JPM Coins it is likely to issue. In contrast, the stablecoins on the market today rarely have any excess reserves at all, and many of them donât even back up their crypto with hard assets whatsoever.The second difference between JPM Coin and the stablecoins on the market: there is no intention to make JPM Coins tradable, and thus, they will never be subject to the ups and downs of the market. âFor a real-time execution, you need a digital currency, because with the digital currency you have the real-time handshake between the parties,â Bussmann adds. âUsing a stablecoin thatâs not depending on the market situation is a solution.âAvoiding speculation in JPM Coin, therefore, differentiates it even from above-board stablecoins (assuming any come along). In addition, JPMorgan is able to position its coin against     Ripple   and the XRP crypto itâs associated with.While Ripple has been positioning XRP as solving cross-border financial transaction issues among banks, there are also indications that Ripple is essentially a scam. Banks around the world are getting wise, and JPMorgan has timed its release of its coin to fill the void that Rippleâs apparent dishonesty is leaving in the marketplace. âWhat weâre seeing is a market change triggered by Ripple and the correspondent banks in a defensive mode,â Bussmann says.Where to From Here?JPMorgan may be targeting both Swift and Ripple with its coin, but itâs clear the bank has other plans as well.In the short term, some people believe the bankâs announcement buoyed flagging interest in cryptos generally, and bitcoin in particular. âWhat some people have pointed to is that because theyâre using distributed ledger technology and theyâre calling it a cryptocurrency, that could have a positive effect on the industry,â predicts Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro.The big win for JPMorgan, however, would be convincing other banks to sign onto using JPM Coin for interbank transactions. âThe smaller the bank, the higher the chance they will use JPM Coin,â says Nelson Rosario, principal at Smolinski Rosario Law. âBuilding your own digital currency requires engineering and resources small banks donât have.âHowever, such a plan is far from smooth sailing for JPMorgan, as other banks are its competitors. Why would they want JPMorgan to control their tokens?Rosario sounds an alarm. âWeâre headed toward a hellscape of infinite coins where itâs as bad as reward points,â he warns. âWeâll have to go through a period of growing pains where every big bank will try to do this.âOther large banks, including Citi, have dipped their toe in the crypto waters as well â but so far, with little success. Given that thereâs little motivation to create a single-bank digital token and even less of a motivation to use a competitorâs, itâs not clear if the whole idea of JPM Coin is inherently flawed.

The cryptocurrency (crypto) world immediately reacted with consternation.Much of the controversy concerns semantics â albeit semantics that represents key questions surrounding crypto. Just what is crypto anyway? And what is it for?                What would J. P. Morgan think about cryptocurrency?    Public domain      What JPM Coin is ForThe bankâs primary spokesperson for JPM Coin is Umar Farooq, Head of Blockchain Initiatives at JP Morganâs Corporate and Investment Bank. âJPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology,â Farooq explains. âExchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin.âFor now, the bank is limiting JPM Coin transactions to large institutional customers only, until such time as regulators have had a chance to weigh in. âJPM Coin is currently a prototype,â Farooq adds. âAs we move towards production we will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.â  In many situations, bank transactions are already instantaneous â so why bother with JPM Coin? âWith all the activity, you can see correspondent banks like JPMorgan are coming under extreme pressure because their role as middlemen is in jeopardy, so now theyâve positioned themselves as âYes, I have a network that my clients can do business and provide real-time execution,â which on the Swift network is not the case,â according to Oliver Bussmann, an active blockchain and crypto company advisor and CEO of Bussmann Advisory, who also served in CIO roles at     SAP   and     UBS  . âThatâs a game changer.âBussmann singles out the aging Swift transaction network as the primary target of JPM Coin. âMy belief is, itâs faster, cheaper and more reliable than the Swift environment, where you have an error rate of 10%-plus,â he adds. âBanks like JPMorgan especially want to be one of the first movers.âIs JPM Coin Crypto?The main reason crypto fans are riled up is because they donât identify JPM Coin as crypto at all. âWhy JPM Coin is a Joke,â writes crypto fan Linas BeliÅ«nas, business development and account executive at Contis Group. âFirst and foremost, we need to understand that JPM Coin has nothing to do with Crypto or Blockchain.âFellow Forbes contributor Madhvi Mavadiya echoes this sentiment in her recent article Stop Calling JPMorganâs JPM Coin A Cryptocurrency, Because Itâs Not. âWhy call it a cryptocurrency when it is just an internal payments system? - for press coverage?â Mavadiya asks. âThis doesnât make sense after the volatility experienced at the end of 2017 and the current attitude towards ICOs.âItâs not only crypto fans to want to distinguish between JPM Coin and crypto. âIn which way has the new alleged JPMorgan crypto coin anything to do with blockchain/crypto?â tweets crypto naysayer Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU Stern School of Business and chairman and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates. âIt is private not public, permissioned not permissionless, based on trusted authorities verifying transaction not trustless, centralized not decentralized. Calling it crypto is a joke.â (See my article on Roubini from August 2018).Roubini, in fact, has put his finger on the problem: crypto fans believe crypto should be public, permissionless, trustless, and decentralized â all things that JPM Coin is not.The problem with this widespread view of crypto, however, is that the primary purpose for such currencies is criminal enterprise, as Iâve written about before. Clearly, JPMorgan wants to have nothing to do with this criminal underworld â and if that means that JPM Coin doesnât qualify as crypto, so much the better.What Does JPM Coin Mean for Blockchain?Even though Roubini rhetorically asks whether JPM Coin has anything to do with blockchain, JPMorgan has, in fact, built its coin on top of Quorum, its own version of the Ethereum blockchain platform. âQuorum is an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum,â according to the JPMorgan web site. âQuorum addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry, and beyond.âFarooq, in fact, believes that blockchains like Quorum are essential for many types of transactions beyond JPM Coin. âThere are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary,â he says.Skeptics, however, wonder whether blockchain is overkill. âFundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain,â says Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management and head of product management, securities finance and collateral management at Broadridge. âThere are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.âNevertheless, JPMorgan has plans for JPM Coin beyond its Quorum blockchain. âThe JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms,â Farooq adds. âJPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks.âItâs not clear, however, how the bank expects to resolve the security and scalability issues of other blockchain networks â an open question that also calls into question JPMorganâs commitment to Quorum.Is JPM Coin a âStablecoinâ?One of JPM Coinâs most important characteristics is how the bank sets its value. âA JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar,â Farooq says. âJPM Coin [is] 1:1 redeemable in fiat currency held by J.P. Morgan (e.g., US$). With a $2.6 trillion balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase N.A. will redeem each JPM Coin in fiat currency.âSome people call a crypto that has a fixed fiat value a âstablecoinâ â although whether JPM Coin is a stablecoin is a controversial question of semantics, similar to the question of whether itâs a crypto at all.Clearly, JPMorgan wouldnât want its coin to be lumped together with the other stablecoins on the market, which I recently pointed out are all Ponzi schemes. The question, therefore, is whether JPM Coin is a Ponzi scheme, and if not, is it a stablecoin at all?Itâs clear that JPMorgan isnât perpetrating a con here, because it is a regulated bank with massive reserves â reserves far in excess of the number of JPM Coins it is likely to issue. In contrast, the stablecoins on the market today rarely have any excess reserves at all, and many of them donât even back up their crypto with hard assets whatsoever.The second difference between JPM Coin and the stablecoins on the market: there is no intention to make JPM Coins tradable, and thus, they will never be subject to the ups and downs of the market. âFor a real-time execution, you need a digital currency, because with the digital currency you have the real-time handshake between the parties,â Bussmann adds. âUsing a stablecoin thatâs not depending on the market situation is a solution.âAvoiding speculation in JPM Coin, therefore, differentiates it even from above-board stablecoins (assuming any come along). In addition, JPMorgan is able to position its coin against     Ripple   and the XRP crypto itâs associated with.While Ripple has been positioning XRP as solving cross-border financial transaction issues among banks, there are also indications that Ripple is essentially a scam. Banks around the world are getting wise, and JPMorgan has timed its release of its coin to fill the void that Rippleâs apparent dishonesty is leaving in the marketplace. âWhat weâre seeing is a market change triggered by Ripple and the correspondent banks in a defensive mode,â Bussmann says.Where to From Here?JPMorgan may be targeting both Swift and Ripple with its coin, but itâs clear the bank has other plans as well.In the short term, some people believe the bankâs announcement buoyed flagging interest in cryptos generally, and bitcoin in particular. âWhat some people have pointed to is that because theyâre using distributed ledger technology and theyâre calling it a cryptocurrency, that could have a positive effect on the industry,â predicts Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro.The big win for JPMorgan, however, would be convincing other banks to sign onto using JPM Coin for interbank transactions. âThe smaller the bank, the higher the chance they will use JPM Coin,â says Nelson Rosario, principal at Smolinski Rosario Law. âBuilding your own digital currency requires engineering and resources small banks donât have.âHowever, such a plan is far from smooth sailing for JPMorgan, as other banks are its competitors. Why would they want JPMorgan to control their tokens?Rosario sounds an alarm. âWeâre headed toward a hellscape of infinite coins where itâs as bad as reward points,â he warns. âWeâll have to go through a period of growing pains where every big bank will try to do this.âOther large banks, including Citi, have dipped their toe in the crypto waters as well â but so far, with little success. Given that thereâs little motivation to create a single-bank digital token and even less of a motivation to use a competitorâs, itâs not clear if the whole idea of JPM Coin is inherently flawed.

The cryptocurrency (crypto) world immediately reacted with consternation.Much of the controversy concerns semantics â albeit semantics that represents key questions surrounding crypto. Just what is crypto anyway? And what is it for?                What would J. P. Morgan think about cryptocurrency?    Public domain      What JPM Coin is ForThe bankâs primary spokesperson for JPM Coin is Umar Farooq, Head of Blockchain Initiatives at JP Morganâs Corporate and Investment Bank. âJPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology,â Farooq explains. âExchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin.âFor now, the bank is limiting JPM Coin transactions to large institutional customers only, until such time as regulators have had a chance to weigh in. âJPM Coin is currently a prototype,â Farooq adds. âAs we move towards production we will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.â  In many situations, bank transactions are already instantaneous â so why bother with JPM Coin? âWith all the activity, you can see correspondent banks like JPMorgan are coming under extreme pressure because their role as middlemen is in jeopardy, so now theyâve positioned themselves as âYes, I have a network that my clients can do business and provide real-time execution,â which on the Swift network is not the case,â according to Oliver Bussmann, an active blockchain and crypto company advisor and CEO of Bussmann Advisory, who also served in CIO roles at     SAP   and     UBS  . âThatâs a game changer.âBussmann singles out the aging Swift transaction network as the primary target of JPM Coin. âMy belief is, itâs faster, cheaper and more reliable than the Swift environment, where you have an error rate of 10%-plus,â he adds. âBanks like JPMorgan especially want to be one of the first movers.âIs JPM Coin Crypto?The main reason crypto fans are riled up is because they donât identify JPM Coin as crypto at all. âWhy JPM Coin is a Joke,â writes crypto fan Linas BeliÅ«nas, business development and account executive at Contis Group. âFirst and foremost, we need to understand that JPM Coin has nothing to do with Crypto or Blockchain.âFellow Forbes contributor Madhvi Mavadiya echoes this sentiment in her recent article Stop Calling JPMorganâs JPM Coin A Cryptocurrency, Because Itâs Not. âWhy call it a cryptocurrency when it is just an internal payments system? - for press coverage?â Mavadiya asks. âThis doesnât make sense after the volatility experienced at the end of 2017 and the current attitude towards ICOs.âItâs not only crypto fans to want to distinguish between JPM Coin and crypto. âIn which way has the new alleged JPMorgan crypto coin anything to do with blockchain/crypto?â tweets crypto naysayer Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU Stern School of Business and chairman and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates. âIt is private not public, permissioned not permissionless, based on trusted authorities verifying transaction not trustless, centralized not decentralized. Calling it crypto is a joke.â (See my article on Roubini from August 2018).Roubini, in fact, has put his finger on the problem: crypto fans believe crypto should be public, permissionless, trustless, and decentralized â all things that JPM Coin is not.The problem with this widespread view of crypto, however, is that the primary purpose for such currencies is criminal enterprise, as Iâve written about before. Clearly, JPMorgan wants to have nothing to do with this criminal underworld â and if that means that JPM Coin doesnât qualify as crypto, so much the better.What Does JPM Coin Mean for Blockchain?Even though Roubini rhetorically asks whether JPM Coin has anything to do with blockchain, JPMorgan has, in fact, built its coin on top of Quorum, its own version of the Ethereum blockchain platform. âQuorum is an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum,â according to the JPMorgan web site. âQuorum addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry, and beyond.âFarooq, in fact, believes that blockchains like Quorum are essential for many types of transactions beyond JPM Coin. âThere are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary,â he says.Skeptics, however, wonder whether blockchain is overkill. âFundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain,â says Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management and head of product management, securities finance and collateral management at Broadridge. âThere are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.âNevertheless, JPMorgan has plans for JPM Coin beyond its Quorum blockchain. âThe JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms,â Farooq adds. âJPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks.âItâs not clear, however, how the bank expects to resolve the security and scalability issues of other blockchain networks â an open question that also calls into question JPMorganâs commitment to Quorum.Is JPM Coin a âStablecoinâ?One of JPM Coinâs most important characteristics is how the bank sets its value. âA JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar,â Farooq says. âJPM Coin [is] 1:1 redeemable in fiat currency held by J.P. Morgan (e.g., US$). With a $2.6 trillion balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase N.A. will redeem each JPM Coin in fiat currency.âSome people call a crypto that has a fixed fiat value a âstablecoinâ â although whether JPM Coin is a stablecoin is a controversial question of semantics, similar to the question of whether itâs a crypto at all.Clearly, JPMorgan wouldnât want its coin to be lumped together with the other stablecoins on the market, which I recently pointed out are all Ponzi schemes. The question, therefore, is whether JPM Coin is a Ponzi scheme, and if not, is it a stablecoin at all?Itâs clear that JPMorgan isnât perpetrating a con here, because it is a regulated bank with massive reserves â reserves far in excess of the number of JPM Coins it is likely to issue. In contrast, the stablecoins on the market today rarely have any excess reserves at all, and many of them donât even back up their crypto with hard assets whatsoever.The second difference between JPM Coin and the stablecoins on the market: there is no intention to make JPM Coins tradable, and thus, they will never be subject to the ups and downs of the market. âFor a real-time execution, you need a digital currency, because with the digital currency you have the real-time handshake between the parties,â Bussmann adds. âUsing a stablecoin thatâs not depending on the market situation is a solution.âAvoiding speculation in JPM Coin, therefore, differentiates it even from above-board stablecoins (assuming any come along). In addition, JPMorgan is able to position its coin against     Ripple   and the XRP crypto itâs associated with.While Ripple has been positioning XRP as solving cross-border financial transaction issues among banks, there are also indications that Ripple is essentially a scam. Banks around the world are getting wise, and JPMorgan has timed its release of its coin to fill the void that Rippleâs apparent dishonesty is leaving in the marketplace. âWhat weâre seeing is a market change triggered by Ripple and the correspondent banks in a defensive mode,â Bussmann says.Where to From Here?JPMorgan may be targeting both Swift and Ripple with its coin, but itâs clear the bank has other plans as well.In the short term, some people believe the bankâs announcement buoyed flagging interest in cryptos generally, and bitcoin in particular. âWhat some people have pointed to is that because theyâre using distributed ledger technology and theyâre calling it a cryptocurrency, that could have a positive effect on the industry,â predicts Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro.The big win for JPMorgan, however, would be convincing other banks to sign onto using JPM Coin for interbank transactions. âThe smaller the bank, the higher the chance they will use JPM Coin,â says Nelson Rosario, principal at Smolinski Rosario Law. âBuilding your own digital currency requires engineering and resources small banks donât have.âHowever, such a plan is far from smooth sailing for JPMorgan, as other banks are its competitors. Why would they want JPMorgan to control their tokens?Rosario sounds an alarm. âWeâre headed toward a hellscape of infinite coins where itâs as bad as reward points,â he warns. âWeâll have to go through a period of growing pains where every big bank will try to do this.âOther large banks, including Citi, have dipped their toe in the crypto waters as well â but so far, with little success. Given that thereâs little motivation to create a single-bank digital token and even less of a motivation to use a competitorâs, itâs not clear if the whole idea of JPM Coin is inherently flawed.

Many banks do it already.âNevertheless, JPMorgan has plans for JPM Coin beyond its Quorum blockchain. âThe JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms,â Farooq adds. âJPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks.âItâs not clear, however, how the bank expects to resolve the security and scalability issues of other blockchain networks â an open question that also calls into question JPMorganâs commitment to Quorum.Is JPM Coin a âStablecoinâ?One of JPM Coinâs most important characteristics is how the bank sets its value. âA JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar,â Farooq says. âJPM Coin [is] 1:1 redeemable in fiat currency held by J.P. Morgan (e.g., US$). With a $2.6 trillion balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase N.A. will redeem each JPM Coin in fiat currency.âSome people call a crypto that has a fixed fiat value a âstablecoinâ â although whether JPM Coin is a stablecoin is a controversial question of semantics, similar to the question of whether itâs a crypto at all.Clearly, JPMorgan wouldnât want its coin to be lumped together with the other stablecoins on the market, which I recently pointed out are all Ponzi schemes. The question, therefore, is whether JPM Coin is a Ponzi scheme, and if not, is it a stablecoin at all?Itâs clear that JPMorgan isnât perpetrating a con here, because it is a regulated bank with massive reserves â reserves far in excess of the number of JPM Coins it is likely to issue. In contrast, the stablecoins on the market today rarely have any excess reserves at all, and many of them donât even back up their crypto with hard assets whatsoever.The second difference between JPM Coin and the stablecoins on the market: there is no intention to make JPM Coins tradable, and thus, they will never be subject to the ups and downs of the market. âFor a real-time execution, you need a digital currency, because with the digital currency you have the real-time handshake between the parties,â Bussmann adds. âUsing a stablecoin thatâs not depending on the market situation is a solution.âAvoiding speculation in JPM Coin, therefore, differentiates it even from above-board stablecoins (assuming any come along). In addition, JPMorgan is able to position its coin against     Ripple   and the XRP crypto itâs associated with.While Ripple has been positioning XRP as solving cross-border financial transaction issues among banks, there are also indications that Ripple is essentially a scam. Banks around the world are getting wise, and JPMorgan has timed its release of its coin to fill the void that Rippleâs apparent dishonesty is leaving in the marketplace. âWhat weâre seeing is a market change triggered by Ripple and the correspondent banks in a defensive mode,â Bussmann says.Where to From Here?JPMorgan may be targeting both Swift and Ripple with its coin, but itâs clear the bank has other plans as well.In the short term, some people believe the bankâs announcement buoyed flagging interest in cryptos generally, and bitcoin in particular. âWhat some people have pointed to is that because theyâre using distributed ledger technology and theyâre calling it a cryptocurrency, that could have a positive effect on the industry,â predicts Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro.The big win for JPMorgan, however, would be convincing other banks to sign onto using JPM Coin for interbank transactions. âThe smaller the bank, the higher the chance they will use JPM Coin,â says Nelson Rosario, principal at Smolinski Rosario Law. âBuilding your own digital currency requires engineering and resources small banks donât have.âHowever, such a plan is far from smooth sailing for JPMorgan, as other banks are its competitors. Why would they want JPMorgan to control their tokens?Rosario sounds an alarm. âWeâre headed toward a hellscape of infinite coins where itâs as bad as reward points,â he warns. âWeâll have to go through a period of growing pains where every big bank will try to do this.âOther large banks, including Citi, have dipped their toe in the crypto waters as well â but so far, with little success. Given that thereâs little motivation to create a single-bank digital token and even less of a motivation to use a competitorâs, itâs not clear if the whole idea of JPM Coin is inherently flawed.

The cryptocurrency (crypto) world immediately reacted with consternation.Much of the controversy concerns semantics â albeit semantics that represents key questions surrounding crypto. Just what is crypto anyway? And what is it for?                What would J. P. Morgan think about cryptocurrency?    Public domain      What JPM Coin is ForThe bankâs primary spokesperson for JPM Coin is Umar Farooq, Head of Blockchain Initiatives at JP Morganâs Corporate and Investment Bank. âJPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology,â Farooq explains. âExchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin.âFor now, the bank is limiting JPM Coin transactions to large institutional customers only, until such time as regulators have had a chance to weigh in. âJPM Coin is currently a prototype,â Farooq adds. âAs we move towards production we will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.â  In many situations, bank transactions are already instantaneous â so why bother with JPM Coin? âWith all the activity, you can see correspondent banks like JPMorgan are coming under extreme pressure because their role as middlemen is in jeopardy, so now theyâve positioned themselves as âYes, I have a network that my clients can do business and provide real-time execution,â which on the Swift network is not the case,â according to Oliver Bussmann, an active blockchain and crypto company advisor and CEO of Bussmann Advisory, who also served in CIO roles at     SAP   and     UBS  . âThatâs a game changer.âBussmann singles out the aging Swift transaction network as the primary target of JPM Coin. âMy belief is, itâs faster, cheaper and more reliable than the Swift environment, where you have an error rate of 10%-plus,â he adds. âBanks like JPMorgan especially want to be one of the first movers.âIs JPM Coin Crypto?The main reason crypto fans are riled up is because they donât identify JPM Coin as crypto at all. âWhy JPM Coin is a Joke,â writes crypto fan Linas BeliÅ«nas, business development and account executive at Contis Group. âFirst and foremost, we need to understand that JPM Coin has nothing to do with Crypto or Blockchain.âFellow Forbes contributor Madhvi Mavadiya echoes this sentiment in her recent article Stop Calling JPMorganâs JPM Coin A Cryptocurrency, Because Itâs Not. âWhy call it a cryptocurrency when it is just an internal payments system? - for press coverage?â Mavadiya asks. âThis doesnât make sense after the volatility experienced at the end of 2017 and the current attitude towards ICOs.âItâs not only crypto fans to want to distinguish between JPM Coin and crypto. âIn which way has the new alleged JPMorgan crypto coin anything to do with blockchain/crypto?â tweets crypto naysayer Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU Stern School of Business and chairman and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates. âIt is private not public, permissioned not permissionless, based on trusted authorities verifying transaction not trustless, centralized not decentralized. Calling it crypto is a joke.â (See my article on Roubini from August 2018).Roubini, in fact, has put his finger on the problem: crypto fans believe crypto should be public, permissionless, trustless, and decentralized â all things that JPM Coin is not.The problem with this widespread view of crypto, however, is that the primary purpose for such currencies is criminal enterprise, as Iâve written about before.

The cryptocurrency (crypto) world immediately reacted with consternation.Much of the controversy concerns semantics â albeit semantics that represents key questions surrounding crypto. Just what is crypto anyway? And what is it for?                What would J. P. Morgan think about cryptocurrency?    Public domain      What JPM Coin is ForThe bankâs primary spokesperson for JPM Coin is Umar Farooq, Head of Blockchain Initiatives at JP Morganâs Corporate and Investment Bank. âJPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology,â Farooq explains. âExchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin.âFor now, the bank is limiting JPM Coin transactions to large institutional customers only, until such time as regulators have had a chance to weigh in. âJPM Coin is currently a prototype,â Farooq adds. âAs we move towards production we will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.â  In many situations, bank transactions are already instantaneous â so why bother with JPM Coin? âWith all the activity, you can see correspondent banks like JPMorgan are coming under extreme pressure because their role as middlemen is in jeopardy, so now theyâve positioned themselves as âYes, I have a network that my clients can do business and provide real-time execution,â which on the Swift network is not the case,â according to Oliver Bussmann, an active blockchain and crypto company advisor and CEO of Bussmann Advisory, who also served in CIO roles at     SAP   and     UBS  . âThatâs a game changer.âBussmann singles out the aging Swift transaction network as the primary target of JPM Coin. âMy belief is, itâs faster, cheaper and more reliable than the Swift environment, where you have an error rate of 10%-plus,â he adds. âBanks like JPMorgan especially want to be one of the first movers.âIs JPM Coin Crypto?The main reason crypto fans are riled up is because they donât identify JPM Coin as crypto at all. âWhy JPM Coin is a Joke,â writes crypto fan Linas BeliÅ«nas, business development and account executive at Contis Group. âFirst and foremost, we need to understand that JPM Coin has nothing to do with Crypto or Blockchain.âFellow Forbes contributor Madhvi Mavadiya echoes this sentiment in her recent article Stop Calling JPMorganâs JPM Coin A Cryptocurrency, Because Itâs Not. âWhy call it a cryptocurrency when it is just an internal payments system? - for press coverage?â Mavadiya asks. âThis doesnât make sense after the volatility experienced at the end of 2017 and the current attitude towards ICOs.âItâs not only crypto fans to want to distinguish between JPM Coin and crypto. âIn which way has the new alleged JPMorgan crypto coin anything to do with blockchain/crypto?â tweets crypto naysayer Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU Stern School of Business and chairman and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates. âIt is private not public, permissioned not permissionless, based on trusted authorities verifying transaction not trustless, centralized not decentralized. Calling it crypto is a joke.â (See my article on Roubini from August 2018).Roubini, in fact, has put his finger on the problem: crypto fans believe crypto should be public, permissionless, trustless, and decentralized â all things that JPM Coin is not.The problem with this widespread view of crypto, however, is that the primary purpose for such currencies is criminal enterprise, as Iâve written about before. Clearly, JPMorgan wants to have nothing to do with this criminal underworld â and if that means that JPM Coin doesnât qualify as crypto, so much the better.What Does JPM Coin Mean for Blockchain?Even though Roubini rhetorically asks whether JPM Coin has anything to do with blockchain, JPMorgan has, in fact, built its coin on top of Quorum, its own version of the Ethereum blockchain platform. âQuorum is an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum,â according to the JPMorgan web site. âQuorum addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry, and beyond.âFarooq, in fact, believes that blockchains like Quorum are essential for many types of transactions beyond JPM Coin. âThere are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary,â he says.Skeptics, however, wonder whether blockchain is overkill. âFundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain,â says Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management and head of product management, securities finance and collateral management at Broadridge. âThere are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.âNevertheless, JPMorgan has plans for JPM Coin beyond its Quorum blockchain. âThe JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms,â Farooq adds. âJPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks.âItâs not clear, however, how the bank expects to resolve the security and scalability issues of other blockchain networks â an open question that also calls into question JPMorganâs commitment to Quorum.Is JPM Coin a âStablecoinâ?One of JPM Coinâs most important characteristics is how the bank sets its value. âA JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar,â Farooq says. âJPM Coin [is] 1:1 redeemable in fiat currency held by J.P. Morgan (e.g., US$). With a $2.6 trillion balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase N.A. will redeem each JPM Coin in fiat currency.âSome people call a crypto that has a fixed fiat value a âstablecoinâ â although whether JPM Coin is a stablecoin is a controversial question of semantics, similar to the question of whether itâs a crypto at all.Clearly, JPMorgan wouldnât want its coin to be lumped together with the other stablecoins on the market, which I recently pointed out are all Ponzi schemes. The question, therefore, is whether JPM Coin is a Ponzi scheme, and if not, is it a stablecoin at all?Itâs clear that JPMorgan isnât perpetrating a con here, because it is a regulated bank with massive reserves â reserves far in excess of the number of JPM Coins it is likely to issue. In contrast, the stablecoins on the market today rarely have any excess reserves at all, and many of them donât even back up their crypto with hard assets whatsoever.The second difference between JPM Coin and the stablecoins on the market: there is no intention to make JPM Coins tradable, and thus, they will never be subject to the ups and downs of the market. âFor a real-time execution, you need a digital currency, because with the digital currency you have the real-time handshake between the parties,â Bussmann adds. âUsing a stablecoin thatâs not depending on the market situation is a solution.âAvoiding speculation in JPM Coin, therefore, differentiates it even from above-board stablecoins (assuming any come along). In addition, JPMorgan is able to position its coin against     Ripple   and the XRP crypto itâs associated with.While Ripple has been positioning XRP as solving cross-border financial transaction issues among banks, there are also indications that Ripple is essentially a scam. Banks around the world are getting wise, and JPMorgan has timed its release of its coin to fill the void that Rippleâs apparent dishonesty is leaving in the marketplace. âWhat weâre seeing is a market change triggered by Ripple and the correspondent banks in a defensive mode,â Bussmann says.Where to From Here?JPMorgan may be targeting both Swift and Ripple with its coin, but itâs clear the bank has other plans as well.In the short term, some people believe the bankâs announcement buoyed flagging interest in cryptos generally, and bitcoin in particular. âWhat some people have pointed to is that because theyâre using distributed ledger technology and theyâre calling it a cryptocurrency, that could have a positive effect on the industry,â predicts Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro.The big win for JPMorgan, however, would be convincing other banks to sign onto using JPM Coin for interbank transactions. âThe smaller the bank, the higher the chance they will use JPM Coin,â says Nelson Rosario, principal at Smolinski Rosario Law. âBuilding your own digital currency requires engineering and resources small banks donât have.âHowever, such a plan is far from smooth sailing for JPMorgan, as other banks are its competitors. Why would they want JPMorgan to control their tokens?Rosario sounds an alarm. âWeâre headed toward a hellscape of infinite coins where itâs as bad as reward points,â he warns. âWeâll have to go through a period of growing pains where every big bank will try to do this.âOther large banks, including Citi, have dipped their toe in the crypto waters as well â but so far, with little success. Given that thereâs little motivation to create a single-bank digital token and even less of a motivation to use a competitorâs, itâs not clear if the whole idea of JPM Coin is inherently flawed.

The cryptocurrency (crypto) world immediately reacted with consternation.Much of the controversy concerns semantics â albeit semantics that represents key questions surrounding crypto. Just what is crypto anyway? And what is it for?                What would J. P. Morgan think about cryptocurrency?    Public domain      What JPM Coin is ForThe bankâs primary spokesperson for JPM Coin is Umar Farooq, Head of Blockchain Initiatives at JP Morganâs Corporate and Investment Bank. âJPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology,â Farooq explains. âExchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin.âFor now, the bank is limiting JPM Coin transactions to large institutional customers only, until such time as regulators have had a chance to weigh in. âJPM Coin is currently a prototype,â Farooq adds. âAs we move towards production we will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.â  In many situations, bank transactions are already instantaneous â so why bother with JPM Coin? âWith all the activity, you can see correspondent banks like JPMorgan are coming under extreme pressure because their role as middlemen is in jeopardy, so now theyâve positioned themselves as âYes, I have a network that my clients can do business and provide real-time execution,â which on the Swift network is not the case,â according to Oliver Bussmann, an active blockchain and crypto company advisor and CEO of Bussmann Advisory, who also served in CIO roles at     SAP   and     UBS  . âThatâs a game changer.âBussmann singles out the aging Swift transaction network as the primary target of JPM Coin. âMy belief is, itâs faster, cheaper and more reliable than the Swift environment, where you have an error rate of 10%-plus,â he adds. âBanks like JPMorgan especially want to be one of the first movers.âIs JPM Coin Crypto?The main reason crypto fans are riled up is because they donât identify JPM Coin as crypto at all. âWhy JPM Coin is a Joke,â writes crypto fan Linas BeliÅ«nas, business development and account executive at Contis Group. âFirst and foremost, we need to understand that JPM Coin has nothing to do with Crypto or Blockchain.âFellow Forbes contributor Madhvi Mavadiya echoes this sentiment in her recent article Stop Calling JPMorganâs JPM Coin A Cryptocurrency, Because Itâs Not. âWhy call it a cryptocurrency when it is just an internal payments system? - for press coverage?â Mavadiya asks. âThis doesnât make sense after the volatility experienced at the end of 2017 and the current attitude towards ICOs.âItâs not only crypto fans to want to distinguish between JPM Coin and crypto. âIn which way has the new alleged JPMorgan crypto coin anything to do with blockchain/crypto?â tweets crypto naysayer Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU Stern School of Business and chairman and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates. âIt is private not public, permissioned not permissionless, based on trusted authorities verifying transaction not trustless, centralized not decentralized. Calling it crypto is a joke.â (See my article on Roubini from August 2018).Roubini, in fact, has put his finger on the problem: crypto fans believe crypto should be public, permissionless, trustless, and decentralized â all things that JPM Coin is not.The problem with this widespread view of crypto, however, is that the primary purpose for such currencies is criminal enterprise, as Iâve written about before. Clearly, JPMorgan wants to have nothing to do with this criminal underworld â and if that means that JPM Coin doesnât qualify as crypto, so much the better.What Does JPM Coin Mean for Blockchain?Even though Roubini rhetorically asks whether JPM Coin has anything to do with blockchain, JPMorgan has, in fact, built its coin on top of Quorum, its own version of the Ethereum blockchain platform. âQuorum is an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum,â according to the JPMorgan web site. âQuorum addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry, and beyond.âFarooq, in fact, believes that blockchains like Quorum are essential for many types of transactions beyond JPM Coin. âThere are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary,â he says.Skeptics, however, wonder whether blockchain is overkill. âFundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain,â says Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management and head of product management, securities finance and collateral management at Broadridge. âThere are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.âNevertheless, JPMorgan has plans for JPM Coin beyond its Quorum blockchain. âThe JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms,â Farooq adds. âJPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks.âItâs not clear, however, how the bank expects to resolve the security and scalability issues of other blockchain networks â an open question that also calls into question JPMorganâs commitment to Quorum.Is JPM Coin a âStablecoinâ?One of JPM Coinâs most important characteristics is how the bank sets its value. âA JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar,â Farooq says. âJPM Coin [is] 1:1 redeemable in fiat currency held by J.P. Morgan (e.g., US$). With a $2.6 trillion balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase N.A. will redeem each JPM Coin in fiat currency.âSome people call a crypto that has a fixed fiat value a âstablecoinâ â although whether JPM Coin is a stablecoin is a controversial question of semantics, similar to the question of whether itâs a crypto at all.Clearly, JPMorgan wouldnât want its coin to be lumped together with the other stablecoins on the market, which I recently pointed out are all Ponzi schemes. The question, therefore, is whether JPM Coin is a Ponzi scheme, and if not, is it a stablecoin at all?Itâs clear that JPMorgan isnât perpetrating a con here, because it is a regulated bank with massive reserves â reserves far in excess of the number of JPM Coins it is likely to issue. In contrast, the stablecoins on the market today rarely have any excess reserves at all, and many of them donât even back up their crypto with hard assets whatsoever.The second difference between JPM Coin and the stablecoins on the market: there is no intention to make JPM Coins tradable, and thus, they will never be subject to the ups and downs of the market. âFor a real-time execution, you need a digital currency, because with the digital currency you have the real-time handshake between the parties,â Bussmann adds. âUsing a stablecoin thatâs not depending on the market situation is a solution.âAvoiding speculation in JPM Coin, therefore, differentiates it even from above-board stablecoins (assuming any come along). In addition, JPMorgan is able to position its coin against     Ripple   and the XRP crypto itâs associated with.While Ripple has been positioning XRP as solving cross-border financial transaction issues among banks, there are also indications that Ripple is essentially a scam. Banks around the world are getting wise, and JPMorgan has timed its release of its coin to fill the void that Rippleâs apparent dishonesty is leaving in the marketplace. âWhat weâre seeing is a market change triggered by Ripple and the correspondent banks in a defensive mode,â Bussmann says.Where to From Here?JPMorgan may be targeting both Swift and Ripple with its coin, but itâs clear the bank has other plans as well.In the short term, some people believe the bankâs announcement buoyed flagging interest in cryptos generally, and bitcoin in particular. âWhat some people have pointed to is that because theyâre using distributed ledger technology and theyâre calling it a cryptocurrency, that could have a positive effect on the industry,â predicts Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro.The big win for JPMorgan, however, would be convincing other banks to sign onto using JPM Coin for interbank transactions. âThe smaller the bank, the higher the chance they will use JPM Coin,â says Nelson Rosario, principal at Smolinski Rosario Law. âBuilding your own digital currency requires engineering and resources small banks donât have.âHowever, such a plan is far from smooth sailing for JPMorgan, as other banks are its competitors. Why would they want JPMorgan to control their tokens?Rosario sounds an alarm. âWeâre headed toward a hellscape of infinite coins where itâs as bad as reward points,â he warns. âWeâll have to go through a period of growing pains where every big bank will try to do this.âOther large banks, including Citi, have dipped their toe in the crypto waters as well â but so far, with little success. Given that thereâs little motivation to create a single-bank digital token and even less of a motivation to use a competitorâs, itâs not clear if the whole idea of JPM Coin is inherently flawed.

The cryptocurrency (crypto) world immediately reacted with consternation.Much of the controversy concerns semantics â albeit semantics that represents key questions surrounding crypto. Just what is crypto anyway? And what is it for?                What would J. P. Morgan think about cryptocurrency?    Public domain      What JPM Coin is ForThe bankâs primary spokesperson for JPM Coin is Umar Farooq, Head of Blockchain Initiatives at JP Morganâs Corporate and Investment Bank. âJPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology,â Farooq explains. âExchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin.âFor now, the bank is limiting JPM Coin transactions to large institutional customers only, until such time as regulators have had a chance to weigh in. âJPM Coin is currently a prototype,â Farooq adds. âAs we move towards production we will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.â  In many situations, bank transactions are already instantaneous â so why bother with JPM Coin? âWith all the activity, you can see correspondent banks like JPMorgan are coming under extreme pressure because their role as middlemen is in jeopardy, so now theyâve positioned themselves as âYes, I have a network that my clients can do business and provide real-time execution,â which on the Swift network is not the case,â according to Oliver Bussmann, an active blockchain and crypto company advisor and CEO of Bussmann Advisory, who also served in CIO roles at     SAP   and     UBS  . âThatâs a game changer.âBussmann singles out the aging Swift transaction network as the primary target of JPM Coin. âMy belief is, itâs faster, cheaper and more reliable than the Swift environment, where you have an error rate of 10%-plus,â he adds. âBanks like JPMorgan especially want to be one of the first movers.âIs JPM Coin Crypto?The main reason crypto fans are riled up is because they donât identify JPM Coin as crypto at all. âWhy JPM Coin is a Joke,â writes crypto fan Linas BeliÅ«nas, business development and account executive at Contis Group. âFirst and foremost, we need to understand that JPM Coin has nothing to do with Crypto or Blockchain.âFellow Forbes contributor Madhvi Mavadiya echoes this sentiment in her recent article Stop Calling JPMorganâs JPM Coin A Cryptocurrency, Because Itâs Not. âWhy call it a cryptocurrency when it is just an internal payments system? - for press coverage?â Mavadiya asks. âThis doesnât make sense after the volatility experienced at the end of 2017 and the current attitude towards ICOs.âItâs not only crypto fans to want to distinguish between JPM Coin and crypto. âIn which way has the new alleged JPMorgan crypto coin anything to do with blockchain/crypto?â tweets crypto naysayer Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU Stern School of Business and chairman and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates. âIt is private not public, permissioned not permissionless, based on trusted authorities verifying transaction not trustless, centralized not decentralized. Calling it crypto is a joke.â (See my article on Roubini from August 2018).Roubini, in fact, has put his finger on the problem: crypto fans believe crypto should be public, permissionless, trustless, and decentralized â all things that JPM Coin is not.The problem with this widespread view of crypto, however, is that the primary purpose for such currencies is criminal enterprise, as Iâve written about before. Clearly, JPMorgan wants to have nothing to do with this criminal underworld â and if that means that JPM Coin doesnât qualify as crypto, so much the better.What Does JPM Coin Mean for Blockchain?Even though Roubini rhetorically asks whether JPM Coin has anything to do with blockchain, JPMorgan has, in fact, built its coin on top of Quorum, its own version of the Ethereum blockchain platform. âQuorum is an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum,â according to the JPMorgan web site. âQuorum addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry, and beyond.âFarooq, in fact, believes that blockchains like Quorum are essential for many types of transactions beyond JPM Coin. âThere are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary,â he says.Skeptics, however, wonder whether blockchain is overkill. âFundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain,â says Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management and head of product management, securities finance and collateral management at Broadridge. âThere are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.âNevertheless, JPMorgan has plans for JPM Coin beyond its Quorum blockchain. âThe JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms,â Farooq adds. âJPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks.âItâs not clear, however, how the bank expects to resolve the security and scalability issues of other blockchain networks â an open question that also calls into question JPMorganâs commitment to Quorum.Is JPM Coin a âStablecoinâ?One of JPM Coinâs most important characteristics is how the bank sets its value. âA JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar,â Farooq says. âJPM Coin [is] 1:1 redeemable in fiat currency held by J.P. Morgan (e.g., US$). With a $2.6 trillion balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase N.A. will redeem each JPM Coin in fiat currency.âSome people call a crypto that has a fixed fiat value a âstablecoinâ â although whether JPM Coin is a stablecoin is a controversial question of semantics, similar to the question of whether itâs a crypto at all.Clearly, JPMorgan wouldnât want its coin to be lumped together with the other stablecoins on the market, which I recently pointed out are all Ponzi schemes. The question, therefore, is whether JPM Coin is a Ponzi scheme, and if not, is it a stablecoin at all?Itâs clear that JPMorgan isnât perpetrating a con here, because it is a regulated bank with massive reserves â reserves far in excess of the number of JPM Coins it is likely to issue. In contrast, the stablecoins on the market today rarely have any excess reserves at all, and many of them donât even back up their crypto with hard assets whatsoever.The second difference between JPM Coin and the stablecoins on the market: there is no intention to make JPM Coins tradable, and thus, they will never be subject to the ups and downs of the market. âFor a real-time execution, you need a digital currency, because with the digital currency you have the real-time handshake between the parties,â Bussmann adds. âUsing a stablecoin thatâs not depending on the market situation is a solution.âAvoiding speculation in JPM Coin, therefore, differentiates it even from above-board stablecoins (assuming any come along). In addition, JPMorgan is able to position its coin against     Ripple   and the XRP crypto itâs associated with.While Ripple has been positioning XRP as solving cross-border financial transaction issues among banks, there are also indications that Ripple is essentially a scam. Banks around the world are getting wise, and JPMorgan has timed its release of its coin to fill the void that Rippleâs apparent dishonesty is leaving in the marketplace. âWhat weâre seeing is a market change triggered by Ripple and the correspondent banks in a defensive mode,â Bussmann says.Where to From Here?JPMorgan may be targeting both Swift and Ripple with its coin, but itâs clear the bank has other plans as well.In the short term, some people believe the bankâs announcement buoyed flagging interest in cryptos generally, and bitcoin in particular. âWhat some people have pointed to is that because theyâre using distributed ledger technology and theyâre calling it a cryptocurrency, that could have a positive effect on the industry,â predicts Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro.The big win for JPMorgan, however, would be convincing other banks to sign onto using JPM Coin for interbank transactions. âThe smaller the bank, the higher the chance they will use JPM Coin,â says Nelson Rosario, principal at Smolinski Rosario Law. âBuilding your own digital currency requires engineering and resources small banks donât have.âHowever, such a plan is far from smooth sailing for JPMorgan, as other banks are its competitors. Why would they want JPMorgan to control their tokens?Rosario sounds an alarm. âWeâre headed toward a hellscape of infinite coins where itâs as bad as reward points,â he warns. âWeâll have to go through a period of growing pains where every big bank will try to do this.âOther large banks, including Citi, have dipped their toe in the crypto waters as well â but so far, with little success. Given that thereâs little motivation to create a single-bank digital token and even less of a motivation to use a competitorâs, itâs not clear if the whole idea of JPM Coin is inherently flawed.

      "textContent": "Last week, JPMorgan Chase  JPM +0%JPMorgan Chase JPM$0$0(+0%)As of 05/19/2019, 01:34am EDT announced the creation of a prototype âdigital coinâ the megabank dubbed JPM Coin. The cryptocurrency (crypto) world immediately reacted with consternation.Much of the controversy concerns semantics â albeit semantics that represents key questions surrounding crypto. Just what is crypto anyway? And what is it for?                What would J. P. Morgan think about cryptocurrency?    Public domain      What JPM Coin is ForThe bankâs primary spokesperson for JPM Coin is Umar Farooq, Head of Blockchain Initiatives at JP Morganâs Corporate and Investment Bank. âJPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology,â Farooq explains. âExchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin.âFor now, the bank is limiting JPM Coin transactions to large institutional customers only, until such time as regulators have had a chance to weigh in. âJPM Coin is currently a prototype,â Farooq adds. âAs we move towards production we will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.â  In many situations, bank transactions are already instantaneous â so why bother with JPM Coin? âWith all the activity, you can see correspondent banks like JPMorgan are coming under extreme pressure because their role as middlemen is in jeopardy, so now theyâve positioned themselves as âYes, I have a network that my clients can do business and provide real-time execution,â which on the Swift network is not the case,â according to Oliver Bussmann, an active blockchain and crypto company advisor and CEO of Bussmann Advisory, who also served in CIO roles at     SAP   and     UBS  . âThatâs a game changer.âBussmann singles out the aging Swift transaction network as the primary target of JPM Coin. âMy belief is, itâs faster, cheaper and more reliable than the Swift environment, where you have an error rate of 10%-plus,â he adds. âBanks like JPMorgan especially want to be one of the first movers.âIs JPM Coin Crypto?The main reason crypto fans are riled up is because they donât identify JPM Coin as crypto at all. âWhy JPM Coin is a Joke,â writes crypto fan Linas BeliÅ«nas, business development and account executive at Contis Group. âFirst and foremost, we need to understand that JPM Coin has nothing to do with Crypto or Blockchain.âFellow Forbes contributor Madhvi Mavadiya echoes this sentiment in her recent article Stop Calling JPMorganâs JPM Coin A Cryptocurrency, Because Itâs Not. âWhy call it a cryptocurrency when it is just an internal payments system? - for press coverage?â Mavadiya asks. âThis doesnât make sense after the volatility experienced at the end of 2017 and the current attitude towards ICOs.âItâs not only crypto fans to want to distinguish between JPM Coin and crypto. âIn which way has the new alleged JPMorgan crypto coin anything to do with blockchain/crypto?â tweets crypto naysayer Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU Stern School of Business and chairman and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates. âIt is private not public, permissioned not permissionless, based on trusted authorities verifying transaction not trustless, centralized not decentralized. Calling it crypto is a joke.â (See my article on Roubini from August 2018).Roubini, in fact, has put his finger on the problem: crypto fans believe crypto should be public, permissionless, trustless, and decentralized â all things that JPM Coin is not.The problem with this widespread view of crypto, however, is that the primary purpose for such currencies is criminal enterprise, as Iâve written about before. Clearly, JPMorgan wants to have nothing to do with this criminal underworld â and if that means that JPM Coin doesnât qualify as crypto, so much the better.What Does JPM Coin Mean for Blockchain?Even though Roubini rhetorically asks whether JPM Coin has anything to do with blockchain, JPMorgan has, in fact, built its coin on top of Quorum, its own version of the Ethereum blockchain platform. âQuorum is an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum,â according to the JPMorgan web site. âQuorum addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry, and beyond.âFarooq, in fact, believes that blockchains like Quorum are essential for many types of transactions beyond JPM Coin. âThere are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary,â he says.Skeptics, however, wonder whether blockchain is overkill. âFundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain,â says Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management and head of product management, securities finance and collateral management at Broadridge. âThere are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.âNevertheless, JPMorgan has plans for JPM Coin beyond its Quorum blockchain. âThe JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms,â Farooq adds. âJPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks.âItâs not clear, however, how the bank expects to resolve the security and scalability issues of other blockchain networks â an open question that also calls into question JPMorganâs commitment to Quorum.Is JPM Coin a âStablecoinâ?One of JPM Coinâs most important characteristics is how the bank sets its value. âA JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar,â Farooq says. âJPM Coin [is] 1:1 redeemable in fiat currency held by J.P. Morgan (e.g., US$). With a $2.6 trillion balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase N.A. will redeem each JPM Coin in fiat currency.âSome people call a crypto that has a fixed fiat value a âstablecoinâ â although whether JPM Coin is a stablecoin is a controversial question of semantics, similar to the question of whether itâs a crypto at all.Clearly, JPMorgan wouldnât want its coin to be lumped together with the other stablecoins on the market, which I recently pointed out are all Ponzi schemes. The question, therefore, is whether JPM Coin is a Ponzi scheme, and if not, is it a stablecoin at all?Itâs clear that JPMorgan isnât perpetrating a con here, because it is a regulated bank with massive reserves â reserves far in excess of the number of JPM Coins it is likely to issue. In contrast, the stablecoins on the market today rarely have any excess reserves at all, and many of them donât even back up their crypto with hard assets whatsoever.The second difference between JPM Coin and the stablecoins on the market: there is no intention to make JPM Coins tradable, and thus, they will never be subject to the ups and downs of the market. âFor a real-time execution, you need a digital currency, because with the digital currency you have the real-time handshake between the parties,â Bussmann adds. âUsing a stablecoin thatâs not depending on the market situation is a solution.âAvoiding speculation in JPM Coin, therefore, differentiates it even from above-board stablecoins (assuming any come along). In addition, JPMorgan is able to position its coin against     Ripple   and the XRP crypto itâs associated with.While Ripple has been positioning XRP as solving cross-border financial transaction issues among banks, there are also indications that Ripple is essentially a scam. Banks around the world are getting wise, and JPMorgan has timed its release of its coin to fill the void that Rippleâs apparent dishonesty is leaving in the marketplace. âWhat weâre seeing is a market change triggered by Ripple and the correspondent banks in a defensive mode,â Bussmann says.Where to From Here?JPMorgan may be targeting both Swift and Ripple with its coin, but itâs clear the bank has other plans as well.In the short term, some people believe the bankâs announcement buoyed flagging interest in cryptos generally, and bitcoin in particular. âWhat some people have pointed to is that because theyâre using distributed ledger technology and theyâre calling it a cryptocurrency, that could have a positive effect on the industry,â predicts Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro.The big win for JPMorgan, however, would be convincing other banks to sign onto using JPM Coin for interbank transactions. âThe smaller the bank, the higher the chance they will use JPM Coin,â says Nelson Rosario, principal at Smolinski Rosario Law. âBuilding your own digital currency requires engineering and resources small banks donât have.âHowever, such a plan is far from smooth sailing for JPMorgan, as other banks are its competitors. Why would they want JPMorgan to control their tokens?Rosario sounds an alarm. âWeâre headed toward a hellscape of infinite coins where itâs as bad as reward points,â he warns. âWeâll have to go through a period of growing pains where every big bank will try to do this.âOther large banks, including Citi, have dipped their toe in the crypto waters as well â but so far, with little success. Given that thereâs little motivation to create a single-bank digital token and even less of a motivation to use a competitorâs, itâs not clear if the whole idea of JPM Coin is inherently flawed.
