Now, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders want to repeat history. At an event on May 9, Ocasio-Cortez suggested a ânot-for-profit public option for basic banking services, and we should be piloting these projects through the USPS,â meaning the United States Postal Service. Itâs a proposal similar to something Sanders proposed during the last campaign cycle. Yet the USPS, currently hemorrhaging billions of dollars, is particularly ill-suited to handle banking and lending services for millions of Americans. Postal banking would be a costly flop, failing consumers and putting taxpayers on the line for another massive bailout. There have been a slew of these sorts of proposals over the years, but most fail to answer a basic question: âwhat kind of interest rates should risky borrowers be charged?â The payday lending industry makes modest profits charging high interest rates to really risky borrowers who are down on their luck and probably canât get money elsewhere. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed. Presumably, then, any âpostal bankingâ proposal would feature borrowing rates far lower than what those with low credit scores currently experience. But this business model just doesnât work. Riskier borrowers tend to have higher default rates, which payday lenders make up for by setting higher overall rates. For these borrowers, a high risk necessitates a higher payoff. But lending to a default-heavy population with low interest rates means that financial losses would almost certainly not be covered. Thatâs why whenever there are strict âusury lawsâ on the books, high interest rate lenders close up shop, leaving vulnerable borrowers with even fewer options. Lawmakers see the beleaguered USPS as an ideal guinea pig for government experimentation precisely because, unlike those lenders, it canât go out of business. Yet unbeknownst to most, the USPS already dabbles in the financial services sector by fulfilling money orders. And they havenât done very well compared to their (non-government-backed) competitors. A 2016 inspector general (IG) report notes, âBetween 2011 and 2013, the number of non-postal money orders actually increased slightly, while postal money order volumes declined by 11 percent.â This trend continued: from fiscal year 2014 through 2018, money order revenue shrank from $164 million to $147 million even as companies such as Money Gram continued to grow. This failing foray into financial markets didnât happen because of strictures imposed by Congress, a popular refrain among progressive members of Congress like Ocasio-Cortez. The IG takes the USPS to task, for instance, for âselling paper money orders through digital channels, such as usps.com and the USPS Mobile app,â a move âwhich would likely not require regulatory approval.â Money losses, then, seem inevitable if the USPS veers into the banking sector. But some proponents suggest that these losses are worth it if the agency services people who truly need affordable bank accounts or loans at affordable interest rates. Fee-free bank accounts are already widely available, offered by financial institutions with the expertise and clout to handle billions of dollars and millions of consumers. Lending, of course, is a different story, but the federal government should think twice before doling out âaffordableâ loans to risky borrowers. In the lead-up to the last financial crisis, those who had no business getting loans were shadily approved, and the resulting turmoil crashed the economy. Policymakers should be loath to make the same mistake again.  \tTaxpayers Win as the Postal Service Gives Stamps.com the Boot \tHow to Save the Postal Service Without Hiking Mail Rates The Postal Service has plenty of financial and management issues already. With a recently reported quarterly loss of more than $2 billion, the USPS has enough core (in)competencies to worry about without getting deeper into the banking business. Yet if Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez get their way, the USPS may end up having something in common with the worst behaving banks circa 2008: it will only survive because of a taxpayer bailout.Ross Marchand is the director of policy for the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMORE FROM THIS AUTHORWith Trump, Thereâs Smoke and Sometimes Fire The Pentagon: Incompetent on Cybersecurity\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHide 26 comments\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26 Responses to Ocasio-Cortez Puts the Postal Service on the Path to Ruin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                      Matt W says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:00 pm        Why does this author think the US Postal Service so uniquely incapable?  In most European nations the Post Office makes a modest profit from its involvement in banking.                                        Kent says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:39 pm        I get the authorâs concerns here. I think the real issue is that the poor really donât have access to free bank accounts from the private sector. They canât keep their balances high enough.So the postal service could be useful in providing free bank accounts, a place to direct deposit pay checks, and a place to turn deposits into cash. The postal service, being a part of government, might also have the ability to auto-deduct loan payments from employer paychecks, disability checks, etcâ¦ Japan uses its postal service for banking purposes, so they might be a good model.My concerns would be more along the lines of scope creep. That what might start as a minimally profitable, conservative mechanism that is of great benefit to an under-served population, over time becomes some horrendous welfare program.As for the postal service losing money, why hasnât our President appointed a top-notch CEO type to work with Congress to fix this issue? I would also think that our Senate would be all over this. This is a fiscal responsibility issue.                                        Joe O'Mahony says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:25 pm        One reason the post office âloses moneyâ is that by law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do. The Republicans saddled the PO with this obligations in order to destroy it. Another good reason not to be a member of the GOP.

Alex Arr says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:02 pm        Postal banking existed between 1910 and 1960 in the United States. The author seems to imply that postal banking is some hare-brained and untested scheme, when that is obviously not the case.

The author would love to see pay day lenders disappear, but they are a fly on the elephant of the banks.  But offering the public something that works well in many highly developed nations might be a âthin edge of the wedgeâ to the government providing basic services at the expense of the Robber Barrons.Thank you â                                        Oleg Gark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:35 pm        I donât know the pros and cons of the current proposals to bring back postal banking, but this article reads like a one-sided hit piece.The words used to describe the USPS include: âbeleagueredâ, âguinea pigâ, âdabblesâ, âveersâ, and âcore (in)competenciesâ.  Furthermore, the author blames the last recession on poor people who had âno business getting loansâ, as if investment banking and Credit Default Swaps had nothing to do with it.If TAC regards their readers as smarter than the average bear, their content should reflect that.                                        tz says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:06 pm        Why is AmCon going full NR?The Postal Service only has problems because they have to reserve actual CASH for retirees, unlike the feds or state governments, or Romneyâs Bain Capitalism where the Pensions Guaranty Benefits trust fund â also taxpayers â will have to pay.I would love to get the traditonal 4% from a postal account.(Have you heard of Japan?)No, you want the bankster oligarchs to make us debt slaves                                        swordfish says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:23 pm        Iâve spent a lot of time driving through New Mexico.  A lot of it is very rugged terrain, and/or Indian reservation.  In many of its tiny towns the only civic building is the post office.  I think weâd want to closely regulate banking via post office, but the suggestion sort of makes sense.  USPS is the only federal agency with the mission (and the infrastructure) to âtouchâ every citizen.                                        TheSnark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:35 pm        In Japan and many European countries the post offices are used for basic banking services, bill payments, etc.  It works well.   Letting the PO get into lending, though, is nuts, for the very reasons the author points out.Using the PO for basic banking would utilize the thousands of under-utilized offices around the country.   Closing those offices would make more sense, but their local congressmen will never allow that.   So you might as well have them do something useful.  In theory.But the author does raise a valid question:  can we trust congress not to mandate that the PO provide services that would lose tons of money?  The record is not good.                                        Brett Champion says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:21 pm        So, she wants people to open bank accounts with an organization that is currently less than a decade away from going out of business without a massive government bailout. I suppose if people are already going to be ticked off about the next time we bail out the banks, then why not.                                        cka2nd says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:27 pm        Gods forbid that the author should look at those countries that already have well-established postal banking services.  And Heaven forfend that he should mention that most of the USPSâ losses are due to the Bush II era mandate to pre-fund retiree health benefits at a rate required of no other institution in either the public or private sector.  Nope, itâs the same swill weâve been served for the last 40 years, âThe market will save us!  The market will save us!âAlso, it is my understanding that the main purpose of a postal bank would be to offer savings accounts where people can actually, you know, save and build their income, and not engage in excessive, let alone high-flying, lending.  But I could be wrong about that.One would think that TAC, with its interest in preserving small towns and neighborhoods, might have asked a writer with an interest in such to review these proposals, rather than publishing the kind of low-hanging fruit churned out by libertarian and Conservative, Inc. think tanks and citizen associations for the last five decades.                                        Bob says:                  May 16, 2019 at 7:37 pm        Iâm not sure I would call using public money to fund a public institution a âbailout.â I would probably just call it âfunding.â But Iâm not a corporate shill.                                        TomG says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:16 am        Mr. Marchand comes off as an apologist for pay-day lenders and goes so far as to say, âOcasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed.â  If pay-day lenders are not predatory, I donât know what is.  And if he thinks we wonât repeat big bank bailouts he is extremely naive.  The âtoo big to failâ model has only expanded since the last melt-down.  North Dakota has a long standing successful public banking industry.  Perhaps we could look at the merits rather than be dismissive on the pretense that pay-day lenders and their so called âmodest profitsâ are doing some service for the working poor.                                        William Gordon says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:26 am        Given how well these âPostâ banks work in quite a few other established countries, I donât see why one couldnât work well, here, too.If the Germans can do it, we can.The comment on the banks being bailed out without consequences for the bankers, though â yes, that was a horrendous mistake.Banks are given special exceptions and powers in order to lubricate the financial system. Unfortunately, they have abandoned the responsibilities that come with those exceptions and powers in favor of undeserved profit.State run banks such as the Post work well in many countries and have for well over a century. The âall government is badâ approach to economics is not wise.Oh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.                                        toshiro_mifune says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:32 am        Didnât the US already have a Post Office Savings Bank? From what Iâve read it was successful in its intended goal of bringing banking services to un/under-served rural areas.Wouldnât a new version be similar albeit with a focus on un/under served urban areas?                                        Siarlys Jenkins says:                  May 17, 2019 at 10:22 am        The post office is probably not the best engine for this proposal. But the substance of it is pure, unadulterated original Populism. One of the basic demands of the agrarian Peopleâs Party was that the federal government establish sub-treasuries in each state to provide low interest lones to farmers, getting them out from under the usurious exploitation of âThe Furnishing Man,â or âThe Hiring Man,â or, to Americans of African descent, simply, âThe Man.â                                        MM says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:03 pm        William: âOh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.âYou mean requiring this government entity to actually fully fund health benefits, not pension benefits incidentally, that they already promised to pay out in the future?Yep, thatâs truly absurd. Too bad the USPS isnât like the rest of the federal government, passing the buck to taxpayers when they donât have enough money to cover their own damn billsâ¦                                        Bill Haywood says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:26 pm        The author assumes the PO will not charge enough interest to cover defaults in order to prove his point, but there is no reason to do so.Note that unlike payday lenders, the PO already has storefronts and infrastructure, and as the PO gets used more, it will sell more money orders, too.                                        sglover says:                  May 17, 2019 at 2:17 pm        @ Joe OâMahony â thanks for your remark.  It speaks volumes that Marchand somehow never gets around to mentioning that little tidbit.  But that would jeopardize that sweet right-wing welfare money.  Marchand doesnât seem to know much or anything about USPS finances, but Iâm sure heâs acutely attentive to his own.For its part, The American Con is really nothing more than a disbursing window for said welfare trough.

Fran Macadam says:                  May 17, 2019 at 5:21 pm        If ever there is sinful usury, it is unquestionably the Payday Loan sharks.You think they help people? They help themselves to the remaining assets of those who canât pay, which is the intention of their trap. Worse than, but just like the credit card banksters who best love those who carry large balances and have to pay maximum interest.                                        Chris Mallory says:                  May 17, 2019 at 7:53 pm        âby law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do.âConsidering the massive shortfalls state run government pensions are facing, it is a shame the rest of government was not required to fully fund pensions.  Now I am going to have my taxes raised to pay for promises made by politicians decades ago.   Better the states go bankrupt.

Now, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders want to repeat history. At an event on May 9, Ocasio-Cortez suggested a ânot-for-profit public option for basic banking services, and we should be piloting these projects through the USPS,â meaning the United States Postal Service. Itâs a proposal similar to something Sanders proposed during the last campaign cycle. Yet the USPS, currently hemorrhaging billions of dollars, is particularly ill-suited to handle banking and lending services for millions of Americans. Postal banking would be a costly flop, failing consumers and putting taxpayers on the line for another massive bailout. There have been a slew of these sorts of proposals over the years, but most fail to answer a basic question: âwhat kind of interest rates should risky borrowers be charged?â The payday lending industry makes modest profits charging high interest rates to really risky borrowers who are down on their luck and probably canât get money elsewhere. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed. Presumably, then, any âpostal bankingâ proposal would feature borrowing rates far lower than what those with low credit scores currently experience. But this business model just doesnât work. Riskier borrowers tend to have higher default rates, which payday lenders make up for by setting higher overall rates. For these borrowers, a high risk necessitates a higher payoff. But lending to a default-heavy population with low interest rates means that financial losses would almost certainly not be covered. Thatâs why whenever there are strict âusury lawsâ on the books, high interest rate lenders close up shop, leaving vulnerable borrowers with even fewer options. Lawmakers see the beleaguered USPS as an ideal guinea pig for government experimentation precisely because, unlike those lenders, it canât go out of business. Yet unbeknownst to most, the USPS already dabbles in the financial services sector by fulfilling money orders. And they havenât done very well compared to their (non-government-backed) competitors. A 2016 inspector general (IG) report notes, âBetween 2011 and 2013, the number of non-postal money orders actually increased slightly, while postal money order volumes declined by 11 percent.â This trend continued: from fiscal year 2014 through 2018, money order revenue shrank from $164 million to $147 million even as companies such as Money Gram continued to grow. This failing foray into financial markets didnât happen because of strictures imposed by Congress, a popular refrain among progressive members of Congress like Ocasio-Cortez. The IG takes the USPS to task, for instance, for âselling paper money orders through digital channels, such as usps.com and the USPS Mobile app,â a move âwhich would likely not require regulatory approval.â Money losses, then, seem inevitable if the USPS veers into the banking sector. But some proponents suggest that these losses are worth it if the agency services people who truly need affordable bank accounts or loans at affordable interest rates. Fee-free bank accounts are already widely available, offered by financial institutions with the expertise and clout to handle billions of dollars and millions of consumers. Lending, of course, is a different story, but the federal government should think twice before doling out âaffordableâ loans to risky borrowers. In the lead-up to the last financial crisis, those who had no business getting loans were shadily approved, and the resulting turmoil crashed the economy. Policymakers should be loath to make the same mistake again.  \tTaxpayers Win as the Postal Service Gives Stamps.com the Boot \tHow to Save the Postal Service Without Hiking Mail Rates The Postal Service has plenty of financial and management issues already. With a recently reported quarterly loss of more than $2 billion, the USPS has enough core (in)competencies to worry about without getting deeper into the banking business. Yet if Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez get their way, the USPS may end up having something in common with the worst behaving banks circa 2008: it will only survive because of a taxpayer bailout.Ross Marchand is the director of policy for the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMORE FROM THIS AUTHORWith Trump, Thereâs Smoke and Sometimes Fire The Pentagon: Incompetent on Cybersecurity\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHide 26 comments\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26 Responses to Ocasio-Cortez Puts the Postal Service on the Path to Ruin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                      Matt W says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:00 pm        Why does this author think the US Postal Service so uniquely incapable?  In most European nations the Post Office makes a modest profit from its involvement in banking.                                        Kent says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:39 pm        I get the authorâs concerns here. I think the real issue is that the poor really donât have access to free bank accounts from the private sector. They canât keep their balances high enough.So the postal service could be useful in providing free bank accounts, a place to direct deposit pay checks, and a place to turn deposits into cash. The postal service, being a part of government, might also have the ability to auto-deduct loan payments from employer paychecks, disability checks, etcâ¦ Japan uses its postal service for banking purposes, so they might be a good model.My concerns would be more along the lines of scope creep. That what might start as a minimally profitable, conservative mechanism that is of great benefit to an under-served population, over time becomes some horrendous welfare program.As for the postal service losing money, why hasnât our President appointed a top-notch CEO type to work with Congress to fix this issue? I would also think that our Senate would be all over this. This is a fiscal responsibility issue.                                        Joe O'Mahony says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:25 pm        One reason the post office âloses moneyâ is that by law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do. The Republicans saddled the PO with this obligations in order to destroy it. Another good reason not to be a member of the GOP.

Alex Arr says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:02 pm        Postal banking existed between 1910 and 1960 in the United States. The author seems to imply that postal banking is some hare-brained and untested scheme, when that is obviously not the case.

The author would love to see pay day lenders disappear, but they are a fly on the elephant of the banks.  But offering the public something that works well in many highly developed nations might be a âthin edge of the wedgeâ to the government providing basic services at the expense of the Robber Barrons.Thank you â                                        Oleg Gark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:35 pm        I donât know the pros and cons of the current proposals to bring back postal banking, but this article reads like a one-sided hit piece.The words used to describe the USPS include: âbeleagueredâ, âguinea pigâ, âdabblesâ, âveersâ, and âcore (in)competenciesâ.  Furthermore, the author blames the last recession on poor people who had âno business getting loansâ, as if investment banking and Credit Default Swaps had nothing to do with it.If TAC regards their readers as smarter than the average bear, their content should reflect that.                                        tz says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:06 pm        Why is AmCon going full NR?The Postal Service only has problems because they have to reserve actual CASH for retirees, unlike the feds or state governments, or Romneyâs Bain Capitalism where the Pensions Guaranty Benefits trust fund â also taxpayers â will have to pay.I would love to get the traditonal 4% from a postal account.(Have you heard of Japan?)No, you want the bankster oligarchs to make us debt slaves                                        swordfish says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:23 pm        Iâve spent a lot of time driving through New Mexico.  A lot of it is very rugged terrain, and/or Indian reservation.  In many of its tiny towns the only civic building is the post office.  I think weâd want to closely regulate banking via post office, but the suggestion sort of makes sense.  USPS is the only federal agency with the mission (and the infrastructure) to âtouchâ every citizen.                                        TheSnark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:35 pm        In Japan and many European countries the post offices are used for basic banking services, bill payments, etc.  It works well.   Letting the PO get into lending, though, is nuts, for the very reasons the author points out.Using the PO for basic banking would utilize the thousands of under-utilized offices around the country.   Closing those offices would make more sense, but their local congressmen will never allow that.   So you might as well have them do something useful.  In theory.But the author does raise a valid question:  can we trust congress not to mandate that the PO provide services that would lose tons of money?  The record is not good.                                        Brett Champion says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:21 pm        So, she wants people to open bank accounts with an organization that is currently less than a decade away from going out of business without a massive government bailout. I suppose if people are already going to be ticked off about the next time we bail out the banks, then why not.                                        cka2nd says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:27 pm        Gods forbid that the author should look at those countries that already have well-established postal banking services.  And Heaven forfend that he should mention that most of the USPSâ losses are due to the Bush II era mandate to pre-fund retiree health benefits at a rate required of no other institution in either the public or private sector.  Nope, itâs the same swill weâve been served for the last 40 years, âThe market will save us!  The market will save us!âAlso, it is my understanding that the main purpose of a postal bank would be to offer savings accounts where people can actually, you know, save and build their income, and not engage in excessive, let alone high-flying, lending.  But I could be wrong about that.One would think that TAC, with its interest in preserving small towns and neighborhoods, might have asked a writer with an interest in such to review these proposals, rather than publishing the kind of low-hanging fruit churned out by libertarian and Conservative, Inc. think tanks and citizen associations for the last five decades.                                        Bob says:                  May 16, 2019 at 7:37 pm        Iâm not sure I would call using public money to fund a public institution a âbailout.â I would probably just call it âfunding.â But Iâm not a corporate shill.                                        TomG says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:16 am        Mr. Marchand comes off as an apologist for pay-day lenders and goes so far as to say, âOcasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed.â  If pay-day lenders are not predatory, I donât know what is.  And if he thinks we wonât repeat big bank bailouts he is extremely naive.  The âtoo big to failâ model has only expanded since the last melt-down.  North Dakota has a long standing successful public banking industry.  Perhaps we could look at the merits rather than be dismissive on the pretense that pay-day lenders and their so called âmodest profitsâ are doing some service for the working poor.                                        William Gordon says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:26 am        Given how well these âPostâ banks work in quite a few other established countries, I donât see why one couldnât work well, here, too.If the Germans can do it, we can.The comment on the banks being bailed out without consequences for the bankers, though â yes, that was a horrendous mistake.Banks are given special exceptions and powers in order to lubricate the financial system. Unfortunately, they have abandoned the responsibilities that come with those exceptions and powers in favor of undeserved profit.State run banks such as the Post work well in many countries and have for well over a century. The âall government is badâ approach to economics is not wise.Oh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.                                        toshiro_mifune says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:32 am        Didnât the US already have a Post Office Savings Bank? From what Iâve read it was successful in its intended goal of bringing banking services to un/under-served rural areas.Wouldnât a new version be similar albeit with a focus on un/under served urban areas?                                        Siarlys Jenkins says:                  May 17, 2019 at 10:22 am        The post office is probably not the best engine for this proposal. But the substance of it is pure, unadulterated original Populism. One of the basic demands of the agrarian Peopleâs Party was that the federal government establish sub-treasuries in each state to provide low interest lones to farmers, getting them out from under the usurious exploitation of âThe Furnishing Man,â or âThe Hiring Man,â or, to Americans of African descent, simply, âThe Man.â                                        MM says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:03 pm        William: âOh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.âYou mean requiring this government entity to actually fully fund health benefits, not pension benefits incidentally, that they already promised to pay out in the future?Yep, thatâs truly absurd. Too bad the USPS isnât like the rest of the federal government, passing the buck to taxpayers when they donât have enough money to cover their own damn billsâ¦                                        Bill Haywood says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:26 pm        The author assumes the PO will not charge enough interest to cover defaults in order to prove his point, but there is no reason to do so.Note that unlike payday lenders, the PO already has storefronts and infrastructure, and as the PO gets used more, it will sell more money orders, too.                                        sglover says:                  May 17, 2019 at 2:17 pm        @ Joe OâMahony â thanks for your remark.  It speaks volumes that Marchand somehow never gets around to mentioning that little tidbit.  But that would jeopardize that sweet right-wing welfare money.  Marchand doesnât seem to know much or anything about USPS finances, but Iâm sure heâs acutely attentive to his own.For its part, The American Con is really nothing more than a disbursing window for said welfare trough.

Fran Macadam says:                  May 17, 2019 at 5:21 pm        If ever there is sinful usury, it is unquestionably the Payday Loan sharks.You think they help people? They help themselves to the remaining assets of those who canât pay, which is the intention of their trap. Worse than, but just like the credit card banksters who best love those who carry large balances and have to pay maximum interest.                                        Chris Mallory says:                  May 17, 2019 at 7:53 pm        âby law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do.âConsidering the massive shortfalls state run government pensions are facing, it is a shame the rest of government was not required to fully fund pensions.  Now I am going to have my taxes raised to pay for promises made by politicians decades ago.   Better the states go bankrupt.

Now, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders want to repeat history. At an event on May 9, Ocasio-Cortez suggested a ânot-for-profit public option for basic banking services, and we should be piloting these projects through the USPS,â meaning the United States Postal Service. Itâs a proposal similar to something Sanders proposed during the last campaign cycle. Yet the USPS, currently hemorrhaging billions of dollars, is particularly ill-suited to handle banking and lending services for millions of Americans. Postal banking would be a costly flop, failing consumers and putting taxpayers on the line for another massive bailout. There have been a slew of these sorts of proposals over the years, but most fail to answer a basic question: âwhat kind of interest rates should risky borrowers be charged?â The payday lending industry makes modest profits charging high interest rates to really risky borrowers who are down on their luck and probably canât get money elsewhere. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed. Presumably, then, any âpostal bankingâ proposal would feature borrowing rates far lower than what those with low credit scores currently experience. But this business model just doesnât work. Riskier borrowers tend to have higher default rates, which payday lenders make up for by setting higher overall rates. For these borrowers, a high risk necessitates a higher payoff. But lending to a default-heavy population with low interest rates means that financial losses would almost certainly not be covered. Thatâs why whenever there are strict âusury lawsâ on the books, high interest rate lenders close up shop, leaving vulnerable borrowers with even fewer options. Lawmakers see the beleaguered USPS as an ideal guinea pig for government experimentation precisely because, unlike those lenders, it canât go out of business. Yet unbeknownst to most, the USPS already dabbles in the financial services sector by fulfilling money orders. And they havenât done very well compared to their (non-government-backed) competitors. A 2016 inspector general (IG) report notes, âBetween 2011 and 2013, the number of non-postal money orders actually increased slightly, while postal money order volumes declined by 11 percent.â This trend continued: from fiscal year 2014 through 2018, money order revenue shrank from $164 million to $147 million even as companies such as Money Gram continued to grow. This failing foray into financial markets didnât happen because of strictures imposed by Congress, a popular refrain among progressive members of Congress like Ocasio-Cortez. The IG takes the USPS to task, for instance, for âselling paper money orders through digital channels, such as usps.com and the USPS Mobile app,â a move âwhich would likely not require regulatory approval.â Money losses, then, seem inevitable if the USPS veers into the banking sector. But some proponents suggest that these losses are worth it if the agency services people who truly need affordable bank accounts or loans at affordable interest rates. Fee-free bank accounts are already widely available, offered by financial institutions with the expertise and clout to handle billions of dollars and millions of consumers. Lending, of course, is a different story, but the federal government should think twice before doling out âaffordableâ loans to risky borrowers. In the lead-up to the last financial crisis, those who had no business getting loans were shadily approved, and the resulting turmoil crashed the economy. Policymakers should be loath to make the same mistake again.  \tTaxpayers Win as the Postal Service Gives Stamps.com the Boot \tHow to Save the Postal Service Without Hiking Mail Rates The Postal Service has plenty of financial and management issues already. With a recently reported quarterly loss of more than $2 billion, the USPS has enough core (in)competencies to worry about without getting deeper into the banking business. Yet if Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez get their way, the USPS may end up having something in common with the worst behaving banks circa 2008: it will only survive because of a taxpayer bailout.Ross Marchand is the director of policy for the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMORE FROM THIS AUTHORWith Trump, Thereâs Smoke and Sometimes Fire The Pentagon: Incompetent on Cybersecurity\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHide 26 comments\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26 Responses to Ocasio-Cortez Puts the Postal Service on the Path to Ruin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                      Matt W says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:00 pm        Why does this author think the US Postal Service so uniquely incapable?  In most European nations the Post Office makes a modest profit from its involvement in banking.                                        Kent says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:39 pm        I get the authorâs concerns here. I think the real issue is that the poor really donât have access to free bank accounts from the private sector. They canât keep their balances high enough.So the postal service could be useful in providing free bank accounts, a place to direct deposit pay checks, and a place to turn deposits into cash. The postal service, being a part of government, might also have the ability to auto-deduct loan payments from employer paychecks, disability checks, etcâ¦ Japan uses its postal service for banking purposes, so they might be a good model.My concerns would be more along the lines of scope creep. That what might start as a minimally profitable, conservative mechanism that is of great benefit to an under-served population, over time becomes some horrendous welfare program.As for the postal service losing money, why hasnât our President appointed a top-notch CEO type to work with Congress to fix this issue? I would also think that our Senate would be all over this. This is a fiscal responsibility issue.                                        Joe O'Mahony says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:25 pm        One reason the post office âloses moneyâ is that by law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do. The Republicans saddled the PO with this obligations in order to destroy it. Another good reason not to be a member of the GOP.                                        Pancho says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:32 pm        Ocasio is not favorite but this is a good one,bank of america ,wells fargo etc have a big abuse specially with low accounts,those who embrace âcapitalismâ should be on this side too (remember competition?)                                        Alex Arr says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:02 pm        Postal banking existed between 1910 and 1960 in the United States. The author seems to imply that postal banking is some hare-brained and untested scheme, when that is obviously not the case.                                        Martin Ranger says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:11 pm        Absolutely nothing in this article is a valid argument against the post office providing basic banking services. Moreover, they seem to be working just fine all over the world.A much better analysis can be found at:https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-postal-banking-1525092593                                        Whine Merchant says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:33 pm        Ah, another shill for Wall Street and the fiance industry.  The author would love to see pay day lenders disappear, but they are a fly on the elephant of the banks.  But offering the public something that works well in many highly developed nations might be a âthin edge of the wedgeâ to the government providing basic services at the expense of the Robber Barrons.Thank you â                                        Oleg Gark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:35 pm        I donât know the pros and cons of the current proposals to bring back postal banking, but this article reads like a one-sided hit piece.The words used to describe the USPS include: âbeleagueredâ, âguinea pigâ, âdabblesâ, âveersâ, and âcore (in)competenciesâ.  Furthermore, the author blames the last recession on poor people who had âno business getting loansâ, as if investment banking and Credit Default Swaps had nothing to do with it.If TAC regards their readers as smarter than the average bear, their content should reflect that.                                        tz says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:06 pm        Why is AmCon going full NR?The Postal Service only has problems because they have to reserve actual CASH for retirees, unlike the feds or state governments, or Romneyâs Bain Capitalism where the Pensions Guaranty Benefits trust fund â also taxpayers â will have to pay.I would love to get the traditonal 4% from a postal account.(Have you heard of Japan?)No, you want the bankster oligarchs to make us debt slaves                                        swordfish says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:23 pm        Iâve spent a lot of time driving through New Mexico.  A lot of it is very rugged terrain, and/or Indian reservation.  In many of its tiny towns the only civic building is the post office.  I think weâd want to closely regulate banking via post office, but the suggestion sort of makes sense.  USPS is the only federal agency with the mission (and the infrastructure) to âtouchâ every citizen.                                        TheSnark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:35 pm        In Japan and many European countries the post offices are used for basic banking services, bill payments, etc.  It works well.   Letting the PO get into lending, though, is nuts, for the very reasons the author points out.Using the PO for basic banking would utilize the thousands of under-utilized offices around the country.   Closing those offices would make more sense, but their local congressmen will never allow that.   So you might as well have them do something useful.  In theory.But the author does raise a valid question:  can we trust congress not to mandate that the PO provide services that would lose tons of money?  The record is not good.                                        Brett Champion says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:21 pm        So, she wants people to open bank accounts with an organization that is currently less than a decade away from going out of business without a massive government bailout. I suppose if people are already going to be ticked off about the next time we bail out the banks, then why not.                                        cka2nd says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:27 pm        Gods forbid that the author should look at those countries that already have well-established postal banking services.  And Heaven forfend that he should mention that most of the USPSâ losses are due to the Bush II era mandate to pre-fund retiree health benefits at a rate required of no other institution in either the public or private sector.  Nope, itâs the same swill weâve been served for the last 40 years, âThe market will save us!  The market will save us!âAlso, it is my understanding that the main purpose of a postal bank would be to offer savings accounts where people can actually, you know, save and build their income, and not engage in excessive, let alone high-flying, lending.  But I could be wrong about that.One would think that TAC, with its interest in preserving small towns and neighborhoods, might have asked a writer with an interest in such to review these proposals, rather than publishing the kind of low-hanging fruit churned out by libertarian and Conservative, Inc. think tanks and citizen associations for the last five decades.                                        Bob says:                  May 16, 2019 at 7:37 pm        Iâm not sure I would call using public money to fund a public institution a âbailout.â I would probably just call it âfunding.â But Iâm not a corporate shill.                                        TomG says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:16 am        Mr. Marchand comes off as an apologist for pay-day lenders and goes so far as to say, âOcasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed.â  If pay-day lenders are not predatory, I donât know what is.  And if he thinks we wonât repeat big bank bailouts he is extremely naive.  The âtoo big to failâ model has only expanded since the last melt-down.  North Dakota has a long standing successful public banking industry.  Perhaps we could look at the merits rather than be dismissive on the pretense that pay-day lenders and their so called âmodest profitsâ are doing some service for the working poor.                                        William Gordon says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:26 am        Given how well these âPostâ banks work in quite a few other established countries, I donât see why one couldnât work well, here, too.If the Germans can do it, we can.The comment on the banks being bailed out without consequences for the bankers, though â yes, that was a horrendous mistake.Banks are given special exceptions and powers in order to lubricate the financial system. Unfortunately, they have abandoned the responsibilities that come with those exceptions and powers in favor of undeserved profit.State run banks such as the Post work well in many countries and have for well over a century. The âall government is badâ approach to economics is not wise.Oh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.                                        toshiro_mifune says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:32 am        Didnât the US already have a Post Office Savings Bank? From what Iâve read it was successful in its intended goal of bringing banking services to un/under-served rural areas.Wouldnât a new version be similar albeit with a focus on un/under served urban areas?                                        Siarlys Jenkins says:                  May 17, 2019 at 10:22 am        The post office is probably not the best engine for this proposal. But the substance of it is pure, unadulterated original Populism. One of the basic demands of the agrarian Peopleâs Party was that the federal government establish sub-treasuries in each state to provide low interest lones to farmers, getting them out from under the usurious exploitation of âThe Furnishing Man,â or âThe Hiring Man,â or, to Americans of African descent, simply, âThe Man.â                                        MM says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:03 pm        William: âOh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.âYou mean requiring this government entity to actually fully fund health benefits, not pension benefits incidentally, that they already promised to pay out in the future?Yep, thatâs truly absurd. Too bad the USPS isnât like the rest of the federal government, passing the buck to taxpayers when they donât have enough money to cover their own damn billsâ¦                                        Bill Haywood says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:26 pm        The author assumes the PO will not charge enough interest to cover defaults in order to prove his point, but there is no reason to do so.Note that unlike payday lenders, the PO already has storefronts and infrastructure, and as the PO gets used more, it will sell more money orders, too.                                        sglover says:                  May 17, 2019 at 2:17 pm        @ Joe OâMahony â thanks for your remark.  It speaks volumes that Marchand somehow never gets around to mentioning that little tidbit.  But that would jeopardize that sweet right-wing welfare money.  Marchand doesnât seem to know much or anything about USPS finances, but Iâm sure heâs acutely attentive to his own.For its part, The American Con is really nothing more than a disbursing window for said welfare trough.                                        TR says:                  May 17, 2019 at 3:55 pm        This guy is a Koch Brothers shill.  TAC ought to be embarrassed, at least unless theyâre charging him advertising rates for his biased information.                                        Fran Macadam says:                  May 17, 2019 at 5:21 pm        If ever there is sinful usury, it is unquestionably the Payday Loan sharks.You think they help people? They help themselves to the remaining assets of those who canât pay, which is the intention of their trap. Worse than, but just like the credit card banksters who best love those who carry large balances and have to pay maximum interest.                                        Chris Mallory says:                  May 17, 2019 at 7:53 pm        âby law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do.âConsidering the massive shortfalls state run government pensions are facing, it is a shame the rest of government was not required to fully fund pensions.  Now I am going to have my taxes raised to pay for promises made by politicians decades ago.   Better the states go bankrupt.

Now, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders want to repeat history. At an event on May 9, Ocasio-Cortez suggested a ânot-for-profit public option for basic banking services, and we should be piloting these projects through the USPS,â meaning the United States Postal Service. Itâs a proposal similar to something Sanders proposed during the last campaign cycle. Yet the USPS, currently hemorrhaging billions of dollars, is particularly ill-suited to handle banking and lending services for millions of Americans. Postal banking would be a costly flop, failing consumers and putting taxpayers on the line for another massive bailout. There have been a slew of these sorts of proposals over the years, but most fail to answer a basic question: âwhat kind of interest rates should risky borrowers be charged?â The payday lending industry makes modest profits charging high interest rates to really risky borrowers who are down on their luck and probably canât get money elsewhere. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed. Presumably, then, any âpostal bankingâ proposal would feature borrowing rates far lower than what those with low credit scores currently experience. But this business model just doesnât work. Riskier borrowers tend to have higher default rates, which payday lenders make up for by setting higher overall rates. For these borrowers, a high risk necessitates a higher payoff. But lending to a default-heavy population with low interest rates means that financial losses would almost certainly not be covered. Thatâs why whenever there are strict âusury lawsâ on the books, high interest rate lenders close up shop, leaving vulnerable borrowers with even fewer options. Lawmakers see the beleaguered USPS as an ideal guinea pig for government experimentation precisely because, unlike those lenders, it canât go out of business. Yet unbeknownst to most, the USPS already dabbles in the financial services sector by fulfilling money orders. And they havenât done very well compared to their (non-government-backed) competitors. A 2016 inspector general (IG) report notes, âBetween 2011 and 2013, the number of non-postal money orders actually increased slightly, while postal money order volumes declined by 11 percent.â This trend continued: from fiscal year 2014 through 2018, money order revenue shrank from $164 million to $147 million even as companies such as Money Gram continued to grow. This failing foray into financial markets didnât happen because of strictures imposed by Congress, a popular refrain among progressive members of Congress like Ocasio-Cortez. The IG takes the USPS to task, for instance, for âselling paper money orders through digital channels, such as usps.com and the USPS Mobile app,â a move âwhich would likely not require regulatory approval.â Money losses, then, seem inevitable if the USPS veers into the banking sector. But some proponents suggest that these losses are worth it if the agency services people who truly need affordable bank accounts or loans at affordable interest rates. Fee-free bank accounts are already widely available, offered by financial institutions with the expertise and clout to handle billions of dollars and millions of consumers. Lending, of course, is a different story, but the federal government should think twice before doling out âaffordableâ loans to risky borrowers. In the lead-up to the last financial crisis, those who had no business getting loans were shadily approved, and the resulting turmoil crashed the economy. Policymakers should be loath to make the same mistake again.  \tTaxpayers Win as the Postal Service Gives Stamps.com the Boot \tHow to Save the Postal Service Without Hiking Mail Rates The Postal Service has plenty of financial and management issues already. With a recently reported quarterly loss of more than $2 billion, the USPS has enough core (in)competencies to worry about without getting deeper into the banking business. Yet if Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez get their way, the USPS may end up having something in common with the worst behaving banks circa 2008: it will only survive because of a taxpayer bailout.Ross Marchand is the director of policy for the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

In most European nations the Post Office makes a modest profit from its involvement in banking.                                        Kent says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:39 pm        I get the authorâs concerns here. I think the real issue is that the poor really donât have access to free bank accounts from the private sector. They canât keep their balances high enough.So the postal service could be useful in providing free bank accounts, a place to direct deposit pay checks, and a place to turn deposits into cash. The postal service, being a part of government, might also have the ability to auto-deduct loan payments from employer paychecks, disability checks, etcâ¦ Japan uses its postal service for banking purposes, so they might be a good model.My concerns would be more along the lines of scope creep. That what might start as a minimally profitable, conservative mechanism that is of great benefit to an under-served population, over time becomes some horrendous welfare program.As for the postal service losing money, why hasnât our President appointed a top-notch CEO type to work with Congress to fix this issue? I would also think that our Senate would be all over this. This is a fiscal responsibility issue.                                        Joe O'Mahony says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:25 pm        One reason the post office âloses moneyâ is that by law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do. The Republicans saddled the PO with this obligations in order to destroy it. Another good reason not to be a member of the GOP.                                        Pancho says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:32 pm        Ocasio is not favorite but this is a good one,bank of america ,wells fargo etc have a big abuse specially with low accounts,those who embrace âcapitalismâ should be on this side too (remember competition?)                                        Alex Arr says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:02 pm        Postal banking existed between 1910 and 1960 in the United States. The author seems to imply that postal banking is some hare-brained and untested scheme, when that is obviously not the case.                                        Martin Ranger says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:11 pm        Absolutely nothing in this article is a valid argument against the post office providing basic banking services. Moreover, they seem to be working just fine all over the world.A much better analysis can be found at:https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-postal-banking-1525092593                                        Whine Merchant says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:33 pm        Ah, another shill for Wall Street and the fiance industry.  The author would love to see pay day lenders disappear, but they are a fly on the elephant of the banks.  But offering the public something that works well in many highly developed nations might be a âthin edge of the wedgeâ to the government providing basic services at the expense of the Robber Barrons.Thank you â                                        Oleg Gark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:35 pm        I donât know the pros and cons of the current proposals to bring back postal banking, but this article reads like a one-sided hit piece.The words used to describe the USPS include: âbeleagueredâ, âguinea pigâ, âdabblesâ, âveersâ, and âcore (in)competenciesâ.  Furthermore, the author blames the last recession on poor people who had âno business getting loansâ, as if investment banking and Credit Default Swaps had nothing to do with it.If TAC regards their readers as smarter than the average bear, their content should reflect that.                                        tz says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:06 pm        Why is AmCon going full NR?The Postal Service only has problems because they have to reserve actual CASH for retirees, unlike the feds or state governments, or Romneyâs Bain Capitalism where the Pensions Guaranty Benefits trust fund â also taxpayers â will have to pay.I would love to get the traditonal 4% from a postal account.(Have you heard of Japan?)No, you want the bankster oligarchs to make us debt slaves                                        swordfish says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:23 pm        Iâve spent a lot of time driving through New Mexico.  A lot of it is very rugged terrain, and/or Indian reservation.  In many of its tiny towns the only civic building is the post office.  I think weâd want to closely regulate banking via post office, but the suggestion sort of makes sense.  USPS is the only federal agency with the mission (and the infrastructure) to âtouchâ every citizen.                                        TheSnark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:35 pm        In Japan and many European countries the post offices are used for basic banking services, bill payments, etc.  It works well.   Letting the PO get into lending, though, is nuts, for the very reasons the author points out.Using the PO for basic banking would utilize the thousands of under-utilized offices around the country.   Closing those offices would make more sense, but their local congressmen will never allow that.   So you might as well have them do something useful.  In theory.But the author does raise a valid question:  can we trust congress not to mandate that the PO provide services that would lose tons of money?  The record is not good.                                        Brett Champion says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:21 pm        So, she wants people to open bank accounts with an organization that is currently less than a decade away from going out of business without a massive government bailout. I suppose if people are already going to be ticked off about the next time we bail out the banks, then why not.                                        cka2nd says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:27 pm        Gods forbid that the author should look at those countries that already have well-established postal banking services.  And Heaven forfend that he should mention that most of the USPSâ losses are due to the Bush II era mandate to pre-fund retiree health benefits at a rate required of no other institution in either the public or private sector.  Nope, itâs the same swill weâve been served for the last 40 years, âThe market will save us!  The market will save us!âAlso, it is my understanding that the main purpose of a postal bank would be to offer savings accounts where people can actually, you know, save and build their income, and not engage in excessive, let alone high-flying, lending.  But I could be wrong about that.One would think that TAC, with its interest in preserving small towns and neighborhoods, might have asked a writer with an interest in such to review these proposals, rather than publishing the kind of low-hanging fruit churned out by libertarian and Conservative, Inc. think tanks and citizen associations for the last five decades.                                        Bob says:                  May 16, 2019 at 7:37 pm        Iâm not sure I would call using public money to fund a public institution a âbailout.â I would probably just call it âfunding.â But Iâm not a corporate shill.                                        TomG says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:16 am        Mr. Marchand comes off as an apologist for pay-day lenders and goes so far as to say, âOcasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed.â  If pay-day lenders are not predatory, I donât know what is.  And if he thinks we wonât repeat big bank bailouts he is extremely naive.  The âtoo big to failâ model has only expanded since the last melt-down.  North Dakota has a long standing successful public banking industry.  Perhaps we could look at the merits rather than be dismissive on the pretense that pay-day lenders and their so called âmodest profitsâ are doing some service for the working poor.                                        William Gordon says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:26 am        Given how well these âPostâ banks work in quite a few other established countries, I donât see why one couldnât work well, here, too.If the Germans can do it, we can.The comment on the banks being bailed out without consequences for the bankers, though â yes, that was a horrendous mistake.Banks are given special exceptions and powers in order to lubricate the financial system. Unfortunately, they have abandoned the responsibilities that come with those exceptions and powers in favor of undeserved profit.State run banks such as the Post work well in many countries and have for well over a century. The âall government is badâ approach to economics is not wise.Oh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.                                        toshiro_mifune says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:32 am        Didnât the US already have a Post Office Savings Bank? From what Iâve read it was successful in its intended goal of bringing banking services to un/under-served rural areas.Wouldnât a new version be similar albeit with a focus on un/under served urban areas?                                        Siarlys Jenkins says:                  May 17, 2019 at 10:22 am        The post office is probably not the best engine for this proposal. But the substance of it is pure, unadulterated original Populism. One of the basic demands of the agrarian Peopleâs Party was that the federal government establish sub-treasuries in each state to provide low interest lones to farmers, getting them out from under the usurious exploitation of âThe Furnishing Man,â or âThe Hiring Man,â or, to Americans of African descent, simply, âThe Man.â                                        MM says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:03 pm        William: âOh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.âYou mean requiring this government entity to actually fully fund health benefits, not pension benefits incidentally, that they already promised to pay out in the future?Yep, thatâs truly absurd. Too bad the USPS isnât like the rest of the federal government, passing the buck to taxpayers when they donât have enough money to cover their own damn billsâ¦                                        Bill Haywood says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:26 pm        The author assumes the PO will not charge enough interest to cover defaults in order to prove his point, but there is no reason to do so.Note that unlike payday lenders, the PO already has storefronts and infrastructure, and as the PO gets used more, it will sell more money orders, too.                                        sglover says:                  May 17, 2019 at 2:17 pm        @ Joe OâMahony â thanks for your remark.  It speaks volumes that Marchand somehow never gets around to mentioning that little tidbit.  But that would jeopardize that sweet right-wing welfare money.  Marchand doesnât seem to know much or anything about USPS finances, but Iâm sure heâs acutely attentive to his own.For its part, The American Con is really nothing more than a disbursing window for said welfare trough.                                        TR says:                  May 17, 2019 at 3:55 pm        This guy is a Koch Brothers shill.  TAC ought to be embarrassed, at least unless theyâre charging him advertising rates for his biased information.                                        Fran Macadam says:                  May 17, 2019 at 5:21 pm        If ever there is sinful usury, it is unquestionably the Payday Loan sharks.You think they help people? They help themselves to the remaining assets of those who canât pay, which is the intention of their trap. Worse than, but just like the credit card banksters who best love those who carry large balances and have to pay maximum interest.                                        Chris Mallory says:                  May 17, 2019 at 7:53 pm        âby law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do.âConsidering the massive shortfalls state run government pensions are facing, it is a shame the rest of government was not required to fully fund pensions.  Now I am going to have my taxes raised to pay for promises made by politicians decades ago.   Better the states go bankrupt.                                        Marty says:                  May 18, 2019 at 3:30 pm        Payday lenders are exemplary, top-notch businesses! Hahahaâ¦                                        Salamander says:                  May 18, 2019 at 5:23 pm        This is the single most intellectually dishonest essay Iâve ever read on TAC.

In most European nations the Post Office makes a modest profit from its involvement in banking.                                        Kent says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:39 pm        I get the authorâs concerns here. I think the real issue is that the poor really donât have access to free bank accounts from the private sector. They canât keep their balances high enough.So the postal service could be useful in providing free bank accounts, a place to direct deposit pay checks, and a place to turn deposits into cash. The postal service, being a part of government, might also have the ability to auto-deduct loan payments from employer paychecks, disability checks, etcâ¦ Japan uses its postal service for banking purposes, so they might be a good model.My concerns would be more along the lines of scope creep. That what might start as a minimally profitable, conservative mechanism that is of great benefit to an under-served population, over time becomes some horrendous welfare program.As for the postal service losing money, why hasnât our President appointed a top-notch CEO type to work with Congress to fix this issue? I would also think that our Senate would be all over this. This is a fiscal responsibility issue.                                        Joe O'Mahony says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:25 pm        One reason the post office âloses moneyâ is that by law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do. The Republicans saddled the PO with this obligations in order to destroy it. Another good reason not to be a member of the GOP.                                        Pancho says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:32 pm        Ocasio is not favorite but this is a good one,bank of america ,wells fargo etc have a big abuse specially with low accounts,those who embrace âcapitalismâ should be on this side too (remember competition?)                                        Alex Arr says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:02 pm        Postal banking existed between 1910 and 1960 in the United States. The author seems to imply that postal banking is some hare-brained and untested scheme, when that is obviously not the case.                                        Martin Ranger says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:11 pm        Absolutely nothing in this article is a valid argument against the post office providing basic banking services. Moreover, they seem to be working just fine all over the world.A much better analysis can be found at:https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-postal-banking-1525092593                                        Whine Merchant says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:33 pm        Ah, another shill for Wall Street and the fiance industry.  The author would love to see pay day lenders disappear, but they are a fly on the elephant of the banks.  But offering the public something that works well in many highly developed nations might be a âthin edge of the wedgeâ to the government providing basic services at the expense of the Robber Barrons.Thank you â                                        Oleg Gark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:35 pm        I donât know the pros and cons of the current proposals to bring back postal banking, but this article reads like a one-sided hit piece.The words used to describe the USPS include: âbeleagueredâ, âguinea pigâ, âdabblesâ, âveersâ, and âcore (in)competenciesâ.  Furthermore, the author blames the last recession on poor people who had âno business getting loansâ, as if investment banking and Credit Default Swaps had nothing to do with it.If TAC regards their readers as smarter than the average bear, their content should reflect that.                                        tz says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:06 pm        Why is AmCon going full NR?The Postal Service only has problems because they have to reserve actual CASH for retirees, unlike the feds or state governments, or Romneyâs Bain Capitalism where the Pensions Guaranty Benefits trust fund â also taxpayers â will have to pay.I would love to get the traditonal 4% from a postal account.(Have you heard of Japan?)No, you want the bankster oligarchs to make us debt slaves                                        swordfish says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:23 pm        Iâve spent a lot of time driving through New Mexico.  A lot of it is very rugged terrain, and/or Indian reservation.  In many of its tiny towns the only civic building is the post office.  I think weâd want to closely regulate banking via post office, but the suggestion sort of makes sense.  USPS is the only federal agency with the mission (and the infrastructure) to âtouchâ every citizen.                                        TheSnark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:35 pm        In Japan and many European countries the post offices are used for basic banking services, bill payments, etc.  It works well.   Letting the PO get into lending, though, is nuts, for the very reasons the author points out.Using the PO for basic banking would utilize the thousands of under-utilized offices around the country.   Closing those offices would make more sense, but their local congressmen will never allow that.   So you might as well have them do something useful.  In theory.But the author does raise a valid question:  can we trust congress not to mandate that the PO provide services that would lose tons of money?  The record is not good.                                        Brett Champion says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:21 pm        So, she wants people to open bank accounts with an organization that is currently less than a decade away from going out of business without a massive government bailout. I suppose if people are already going to be ticked off about the next time we bail out the banks, then why not.                                        cka2nd says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:27 pm        Gods forbid that the author should look at those countries that already have well-established postal banking services.  And Heaven forfend that he should mention that most of the USPSâ losses are due to the Bush II era mandate to pre-fund retiree health benefits at a rate required of no other institution in either the public or private sector.  Nope, itâs the same swill weâve been served for the last 40 years, âThe market will save us!  The market will save us!âAlso, it is my understanding that the main purpose of a postal bank would be to offer savings accounts where people can actually, you know, save and build their income, and not engage in excessive, let alone high-flying, lending.  But I could be wrong about that.One would think that TAC, with its interest in preserving small towns and neighborhoods, might have asked a writer with an interest in such to review these proposals, rather than publishing the kind of low-hanging fruit churned out by libertarian and Conservative, Inc. think tanks and citizen associations for the last five decades.                                        Bob says:                  May 16, 2019 at 7:37 pm        Iâm not sure I would call using public money to fund a public institution a âbailout.â I would probably just call it âfunding.â But Iâm not a corporate shill.                                        TomG says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:16 am        Mr. Marchand comes off as an apologist for pay-day lenders and goes so far as to say, âOcasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed.â  If pay-day lenders are not predatory, I donât know what is.  And if he thinks we wonât repeat big bank bailouts he is extremely naive.  The âtoo big to failâ model has only expanded since the last melt-down.  North Dakota has a long standing successful public banking industry.  Perhaps we could look at the merits rather than be dismissive on the pretense that pay-day lenders and their so called âmodest profitsâ are doing some service for the working poor.                                        William Gordon says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:26 am        Given how well these âPostâ banks work in quite a few other established countries, I donât see why one couldnât work well, here, too.If the Germans can do it, we can.The comment on the banks being bailed out without consequences for the bankers, though â yes, that was a horrendous mistake.Banks are given special exceptions and powers in order to lubricate the financial system. Unfortunately, they have abandoned the responsibilities that come with those exceptions and powers in favor of undeserved profit.State run banks such as the Post work well in many countries and have for well over a century. The âall government is badâ approach to economics is not wise.Oh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.                                        toshiro_mifune says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:32 am        Didnât the US already have a Post Office Savings Bank? From what Iâve read it was successful in its intended goal of bringing banking services to un/under-served rural areas.Wouldnât a new version be similar albeit with a focus on un/under served urban areas?                                        Siarlys Jenkins says:                  May 17, 2019 at 10:22 am        The post office is probably not the best engine for this proposal. But the substance of it is pure, unadulterated original Populism. One of the basic demands of the agrarian Peopleâs Party was that the federal government establish sub-treasuries in each state to provide low interest lones to farmers, getting them out from under the usurious exploitation of âThe Furnishing Man,â or âThe Hiring Man,â or, to Americans of African descent, simply, âThe Man.â                                        MM says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:03 pm        William: âOh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.âYou mean requiring this government entity to actually fully fund health benefits, not pension benefits incidentally, that they already promised to pay out in the future?Yep, thatâs truly absurd. Too bad the USPS isnât like the rest of the federal government, passing the buck to taxpayers when they donât have enough money to cover their own damn billsâ¦                                        Bill Haywood says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:26 pm        The author assumes the PO will not charge enough interest to cover defaults in order to prove his point, but there is no reason to do so.Note that unlike payday lenders, the PO already has storefronts and infrastructure, and as the PO gets used more, it will sell more money orders, too.                                        sglover says:                  May 17, 2019 at 2:17 pm        @ Joe OâMahony â thanks for your remark.  It speaks volumes that Marchand somehow never gets around to mentioning that little tidbit.  But that would jeopardize that sweet right-wing welfare money.  Marchand doesnât seem to know much or anything about USPS finances, but Iâm sure heâs acutely attentive to his own.For its part, The American Con is really nothing more than a disbursing window for said welfare trough.                                        TR says:                  May 17, 2019 at 3:55 pm        This guy is a Koch Brothers shill.  TAC ought to be embarrassed, at least unless theyâre charging him advertising rates for his biased information.                                        Fran Macadam says:                  May 17, 2019 at 5:21 pm        If ever there is sinful usury, it is unquestionably the Payday Loan sharks.You think they help people? They help themselves to the remaining assets of those who canât pay, which is the intention of their trap. Worse than, but just like the credit card banksters who best love those who carry large balances and have to pay maximum interest.                                        Chris Mallory says:                  May 17, 2019 at 7:53 pm        âby law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do.âConsidering the massive shortfalls state run government pensions are facing, it is a shame the rest of government was not required to fully fund pensions.  Now I am going to have my taxes raised to pay for promises made by politicians decades ago.   Better the states go bankrupt.                                        Marty says:                  May 18, 2019 at 3:30 pm        Payday lenders are exemplary, top-notch businesses! Hahahaâ¦                                        Salamander says:                  May 18, 2019 at 5:23 pm        This is the single most intellectually dishonest essay Iâve ever read on TAC.  It speaks volumes about the character of its author.                  \t\t\t\t\t\tLeave a Reply Cancel reply\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour email address will not be published.

      "textContent": " Matt W says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:00 pm        Why does this author think the US Postal Service so uniquely incapable?  In most European nations the Post Office makes a modest profit from its involvement in banking.                                        Kent says:                  May 16, 2019 at 2:39 pm        I get the authorâs concerns here. I think the real issue is that the poor really donât have access to free bank accounts from the private sector. They canât keep their balances high enough.So the postal service could be useful in providing free bank accounts, a place to direct deposit pay checks, and a place to turn deposits into cash. The postal service, being a part of government, might also have the ability to auto-deduct loan payments from employer paychecks, disability checks, etcâ¦ Japan uses its postal service for banking purposes, so they might be a good model.My concerns would be more along the lines of scope creep. That what might start as a minimally profitable, conservative mechanism that is of great benefit to an under-served population, over time becomes some horrendous welfare program.As for the postal service losing money, why hasnât our President appointed a top-notch CEO type to work with Congress to fix this issue? I would also think that our Senate would be all over this. This is a fiscal responsibility issue.                                        Joe O'Mahony says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:25 pm        One reason the post office âloses moneyâ is that by law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do. The Republicans saddled the PO with this obligations in order to destroy it. Another good reason not to be a member of the GOP.                                        Pancho says:                  May 16, 2019 at 3:32 pm        Ocasio is not favorite but this is a good one,bank of america ,wells fargo etc have a big abuse specially with low accounts,those who embrace âcapitalismâ should be on this side too (remember competition?)                                        Alex Arr says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:02 pm        Postal banking existed between 1910 and 1960 in the United States. The author seems to imply that postal banking is some hare-brained and untested scheme, when that is obviously not the case.                                        Martin Ranger says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:11 pm        Absolutely nothing in this article is a valid argument against the post office providing basic banking services. Moreover, they seem to be working just fine all over the world.A much better analysis can be found at:https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-postal-banking-1525092593                                        Whine Merchant says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:33 pm        Ah, another shill for Wall Street and the fiance industry.  The author would love to see pay day lenders disappear, but they are a fly on the elephant of the banks.  But offering the public something that works well in many highly developed nations might be a âthin edge of the wedgeâ to the government providing basic services at the expense of the Robber Barrons.Thank you â                                        Oleg Gark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 4:35 pm        I donât know the pros and cons of the current proposals to bring back postal banking, but this article reads like a one-sided hit piece.The words used to describe the USPS include: âbeleagueredâ, âguinea pigâ, âdabblesâ, âveersâ, and âcore (in)competenciesâ.  Furthermore, the author blames the last recession on poor people who had âno business getting loansâ, as if investment banking and Credit Default Swaps had nothing to do with it.If TAC regards their readers as smarter than the average bear, their content should reflect that.                                        tz says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:06 pm        Why is AmCon going full NR?The Postal Service only has problems because they have to reserve actual CASH for retirees, unlike the feds or state governments, or Romneyâs Bain Capitalism where the Pensions Guaranty Benefits trust fund â also taxpayers â will have to pay.I would love to get the traditonal 4% from a postal account.(Have you heard of Japan?)No, you want the bankster oligarchs to make us debt slaves                                        swordfish says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:23 pm        Iâve spent a lot of time driving through New Mexico.  A lot of it is very rugged terrain, and/or Indian reservation.  In many of its tiny towns the only civic building is the post office.  I think weâd want to closely regulate banking via post office, but the suggestion sort of makes sense.  USPS is the only federal agency with the mission (and the infrastructure) to âtouchâ every citizen.                                        TheSnark says:                  May 16, 2019 at 5:35 pm        In Japan and many European countries the post offices are used for basic banking services, bill payments, etc.  It works well.   Letting the PO get into lending, though, is nuts, for the very reasons the author points out.Using the PO for basic banking would utilize the thousands of under-utilized offices around the country.   Closing those offices would make more sense, but their local congressmen will never allow that.   So you might as well have them do something useful.  In theory.But the author does raise a valid question:  can we trust congress not to mandate that the PO provide services that would lose tons of money?  The record is not good.                                        Brett Champion says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:21 pm        So, she wants people to open bank accounts with an organization that is currently less than a decade away from going out of business without a massive government bailout. I suppose if people are already going to be ticked off about the next time we bail out the banks, then why not.                                        cka2nd says:                  May 16, 2019 at 6:27 pm        Gods forbid that the author should look at those countries that already have well-established postal banking services.  And Heaven forfend that he should mention that most of the USPSâ losses are due to the Bush II era mandate to pre-fund retiree health benefits at a rate required of no other institution in either the public or private sector.  Nope, itâs the same swill weâve been served for the last 40 years, âThe market will save us!  The market will save us!âAlso, it is my understanding that the main purpose of a postal bank would be to offer savings accounts where people can actually, you know, save and build their income, and not engage in excessive, let alone high-flying, lending.  But I could be wrong about that.One would think that TAC, with its interest in preserving small towns and neighborhoods, might have asked a writer with an interest in such to review these proposals, rather than publishing the kind of low-hanging fruit churned out by libertarian and Conservative, Inc. think tanks and citizen associations for the last five decades.                                        Bob says:                  May 16, 2019 at 7:37 pm        Iâm not sure I would call using public money to fund a public institution a âbailout.â I would probably just call it âfunding.â But Iâm not a corporate shill.                                        TomG says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:16 am        Mr. Marchand comes off as an apologist for pay-day lenders and goes so far as to say, âOcasio-Cortez and Sanders believe these loans are predatory and want to see rates capped and payday lenders destroyed.â  If pay-day lenders are not predatory, I donât know what is.  And if he thinks we wonât repeat big bank bailouts he is extremely naive.  The âtoo big to failâ model has only expanded since the last melt-down.  North Dakota has a long standing successful public banking industry.  Perhaps we could look at the merits rather than be dismissive on the pretense that pay-day lenders and their so called âmodest profitsâ are doing some service for the working poor.                                        William Gordon says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:26 am        Given how well these âPostâ banks work in quite a few other established countries, I donât see why one couldnât work well, here, too.If the Germans can do it, we can.The comment on the banks being bailed out without consequences for the bankers, though â yes, that was a horrendous mistake.Banks are given special exceptions and powers in order to lubricate the financial system. Unfortunately, they have abandoned the responsibilities that come with those exceptions and powers in favor of undeserved profit.State run banks such as the Post work well in many countries and have for well over a century. The âall government is badâ approach to economics is not wise.Oh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.                                        toshiro_mifune says:                  May 17, 2019 at 9:32 am        Didnât the US already have a Post Office Savings Bank? From what Iâve read it was successful in its intended goal of bringing banking services to un/under-served rural areas.Wouldnât a new version be similar albeit with a focus on un/under served urban areas?                                        Siarlys Jenkins says:                  May 17, 2019 at 10:22 am        The post office is probably not the best engine for this proposal. But the substance of it is pure, unadulterated original Populism. One of the basic demands of the agrarian Peopleâs Party was that the federal government establish sub-treasuries in each state to provide low interest lones to farmers, getting them out from under the usurious exploitation of âThe Furnishing Man,â or âThe Hiring Man,â or, to Americans of African descent, simply, âThe Man.â                                        MM says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:03 pm        William: âOh, and the post office wouldnât be in such trouble is Republicans hadnât forced such absurd pension fund demands on them to punish them.âYou mean requiring this government entity to actually fully fund health benefits, not pension benefits incidentally, that they already promised to pay out in the future?Yep, thatâs truly absurd. Too bad the USPS isnât like the rest of the federal government, passing the buck to taxpayers when they donât have enough money to cover their own damn billsâ¦                                        Bill Haywood says:                  May 17, 2019 at 1:26 pm        The author assumes the PO will not charge enough interest to cover defaults in order to prove his point, but there is no reason to do so.Note that unlike payday lenders, the PO already has storefronts and infrastructure, and as the PO gets used more, it will sell more money orders, too.                                        sglover says:                  May 17, 2019 at 2:17 pm        @ Joe OâMahony â thanks for your remark.  It speaks volumes that Marchand somehow never gets around to mentioning that little tidbit.  But that would jeopardize that sweet right-wing welfare money.  Marchand doesnât seem to know much or anything about USPS finances, but Iâm sure heâs acutely attentive to his own.For its part, The American Con is really nothing more than a disbursing window for said welfare trough.                                        TR says:                  May 17, 2019 at 3:55 pm        This guy is a Koch Brothers shill.  TAC ought to be embarrassed, at least unless theyâre charging him advertising rates for his biased information.                                        Fran Macadam says:                  May 17, 2019 at 5:21 pm        If ever there is sinful usury, it is unquestionably the Payday Loan sharks.You think they help people? They help themselves to the remaining assets of those who canât pay, which is the intention of their trap. Worse than, but just like the credit card banksters who best love those who carry large balances and have to pay maximum interest.                                        Chris Mallory says:                  May 17, 2019 at 7:53 pm        âby law it must pre-pay pension and health care costs something the rest of the government and private business are not required to do.âConsidering the massive shortfalls state run government pensions are facing, it is a shame the rest of government was not required to fully fund pensions.  Now I am going to have my taxes raised to pay for promises made by politicians decades ago.   Better the states go bankrupt.
